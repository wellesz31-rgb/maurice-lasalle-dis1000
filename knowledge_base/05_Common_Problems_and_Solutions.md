### "I want to make a sub-page but don't know how"

**Solution:**
1. Click the **Pages** tab
2. Find the main page you want to nest under
3. **Method 1:** Click the three dots (⋮) next to the page → Select "Add subpage"
4. **Method 2:** Create a new page, then drag it slightly to the right under the main page

**How to tell it worked:** The sub-page appears indented under the main page in the Pages list.

---

### "I added content but my instructor says they can't see it"

**Most common cause:** You forgot to publish after making changes.

**Solution:**
1. Click the **Publish** button (top-right, blue)
2. Confirm settings
3. Click **Publish**
4. Verify by visiting your published site URL in a new browser tab

**Remember:** From the syllabus: "You must re-publish your site any time you add to it or make changes."

---

### "I deleted a page by accident"

**Bad news:** Google Sites doesn't have an "undo delete" feature for pages.

**Solution:**
1. Recreate the page with the same name
2. Re-add the content (if you saved it elsewhere, copy and paste)
3. Re-publish

**Prevention:** Before deleting anything, double-check that you really want to delete it.

---

### "My site structure doesn't match the model site"

**Solution:**
1. Visit the model site: https://sites.google.com/view/dis1000sp26/home
2. Compare your Pages list to the model site's structure
3. According to the syllabus, you need:
   - **Home** (with About Me and Best Possible Future)
   - **Studio Work**
   - **Fieldwork**
   - **Resilience**
   - **Connection to Your Major**
4. Create any missing pages
5. Rearrange pages by dragging in the Pages list to match
6. Publish after fixing

---

### "I can't figure out how to embed content"

**Solution:**
1. Click where you want the content to appear
2. On the right side, click **Insert** tab
3. Click **Embed** (icon looks like `<>`)
4. Choose **By URL** tab
5. Paste the link to your content (Google Drive file, YouTube video, etc.)
6. Click **Insert**

**See Document 4 for detailed audio embedding instructions.**

---

### "My formatting looks weird"

**Common causes:**
- Copied and pasted from Word/email and brought hidden formatting
- Used inconsistent formatting across the page

**Solution:**
1. Highlight the problematic text
2. Click the **"Remove formatting"** button (looks like a T with an X)
3. Reapply simple formatting (bold, headings) as needed

---

### "People can't access my site"

**Possible causes:**
1. You haven't published yet
2. Site permissions are set to "Restricted"
3. You're sharing the wrong URL

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you've clicked **Publish**
2. Click **Settings** (gear icon)
3. Under Visibility, check that it's set to "Anyone with the link" (not Restricted)
4. Copy the published site URL (looks like `https://sites.google.com/view/yoursite/`)
5. Share that URL, not your editing URL

---

## Cakewalk Issues

### "Cakewalk won't open or crashes on startup"

**Solutions to try:**
1. Restart your computer
2. Check if Windows needs updates (Settings → Update & Security)
3. Make sure you have Cakewalk Next installed (not an older version)
4. Uninstall and reinstall Cakewalk Next
5. Check the BandLab Cakewalk forums for known issues

**If none of this works:** The student may need to use a different computer or contact IT support.

---

### "I can't hear any sound when I play my project"

**Checklist to go through:**
1. ☐ Master track volume—is it turned up?
2. ☐ Individual track volumes—are they turned up?
3. ☐ Are any tracks muted? (M button lit = muted)
4. ☐ Windows system volume—is it turned up?
5. ☐ Headphones/speakers—are they plugged in and powered on?
6. ☐ Is the correct audio device selected in Cakewalk?
   - File → Preferences → Audio → Devices
   - Check that your speakers/headphones are selected as the output

**If still no sound:** Try playing audio in another program (YouTube, Spotify) to verify the computer's audio system works.

---

### "I added an instrument track but there's no sound"

**Common causes:**
1. The track is empty (no MIDI notes or audio clips)
2. The instrument didn't load properly
3. The track is muted or volume is down

**Solution:**
1. Check if the track actually has content on it (clips, loops, or recorded audio)
   - If it's blank, you need to add loops or record something
2. Look at the track in the inspector—is the instrument actually loaded?
3. Check track volume and mute status
4. Try removing the instrument and adding it again

---

### "How do I add a drum beat/bass line/melody?"

**Solution—Use BandLab Loops:**
1. Click **View** → **Show BandLab Sounds** (or press 'B' or F5)
2. The Browser panel opens on the right
3. Click **Inspect** tab
4. Browse **Loops** by instrument type (Drums, Bass, etc.)
5. Click on a loop to preview it
6. Drag promising loops onto your timeline
7. Cakewalk creates the appropriate track automatically

**Alternative—Use Virtual Instruments:**
1. Insert → Insert Instrument Track
2. Browse instruments by category
3. Select an instrument (e.g., Drum Kit, Piano, Bass)
4. Add notes using MIDI or drag loops onto the instrument track

---

### "My tracks are out of sync / not lining up"

**Solution:**
1. Make sure **Snap to Grid** is enabled (magnet icon in toolbar)
2. Check that all clips start on a beat or measure line
3. Look at the grid—if clips are starting between beats, drag them to snap to the nearest beat
4. Verify the tempo hasn't changed midway through the project

---

### "Cakewalk is running really slow"

**Common causes:**
- Too many effects/plugins loaded
- Computer resources are limited
- Large project with many tracks

**Solutions:**
1. Close other programs to free up RAM
2. Reduce the number of tracks you're working with simultaneously
3. Remove unnecessary effects
4. Save and restart Cakewalk
5. Restart the computer

**If persistently slow:** The computer may not meet Cakewalk's requirements—student might need to use a different machine.

---

### "I don't know what sounds to use for my assignment"

**This is partially a creative question, but you can help with the technical side:**

**For exploring sounds:**
1. Open the Browser panel ('B' or F5)
2. Click **Inspect** → **Instruments**
3. Browse categories and click instruments to preview them
4. Try instruments that seem interesting
5. Don't overthink—experiment!

**For specific assignments:**
- **Sound Composition:** Try pads, ambient sounds, textured synths
- **Beats and Loops:** Browse drum loops
- **Emotional Melody:** Try piano, strings, or lead synths
- **Blues:** Look for bass loops, blues piano, guitar sounds

**Remind students:** There's no "wrong" sound choice as long as it fits the assignment goals. The instructor evaluates creative decisions, not whether they picked the "perfect" sound.

---

## Exporting Issues

### "I can't find my exported WAV file"

**Solution:**
1. Check the folder you selected during export (if you remember it)
2. Look in your Cakewalk project folder:
   - `Documents/Cakewalk Projects/[ProjectName]/Audio/`
3. Search your entire computer for `*.wav` files modified today:
   - Windows search: Click Start, type `*.wav`, filter by "Date modified"
4. If you still can't find it, export again and pay close attention to where you're saving

**Prevention tip:** Create a dedicated folder (like `Documents/DIS1000/Exports/`) and always save there.

---

### "My exported file is silent / has no sound"

**Common causes:**
1. All tracks were muted during export
2. Master volume was turned all the way down
3. Wrong source selected (exported a single track instead of Master)

**Solution:**
1. Open your project in Cakewalk
2. Check that tracks are NOT muted (M buttons should not be lit)
3. Check Master track volume (should be around 0 dB, not -inf)
4. Re-export:
   - File → Export Audio
   - Source: **Master** (not a single track)
   - Range: **Entire project**
5. Play the exported file in Windows Media Player to verify it has sound

---

### "I don't know how to export to WAV"

**Step-by-step solution:**
1. Make sure your project is complete and sounds right
2. Click **File** → **Export Audio** (or Ctrl+E)
3. In the Export Audio dialog:
   - **Source:** Master
   - **Range:** Entire project
   - **File type:** WAV
   - **Sample rate:** 44100 Hz
   - **Bit depth:** 16 bit
4. Click the **Export** button at the bottom
5. Choose where to save (use a dedicated folder)
6. Name your file clearly (e.g., `Turner_Week1_SoundComp.wav`)
7. Click **Save**
8. Wait for the export to complete

**See Document 3 for detailed export instructions with visuals.**

---

### "My exported file is huge"

**Is it actually too large?**
- 1 minute of WAV audio ≈ 10 MB
- 2-3 minutes ≈ 20-30 MB
- This is normal for WAV files (they're uncompressed)

**If the file is unusually large (100+ MB for a 3-minute song):**
- You might have exported more than you intended (e.g., 10 minutes of blank space after the song)
- In Cakewalk, check the timeline and make sure your content ends where you think it does
- Re-export, selecting only the section with actual music

---

### "I exported as MP3 instead of WAV"

**Problem:** The course requires WAV files.

**Solution:**
1. Go back to Cakewalk
2. File → Export Audio
3. In **File type**, make sure you select **WAV** (not MP3, not M4A)
4. Re-export

**Why WAV?** WAV is uncompressed and works reliably for embedding in Google Sites. It's a course requirement.

---

## Google Drive & Embedding Issues

### "I uploaded my file but don't know how to share it"

**Solution:**
1. In Google Drive, find your uploaded WAV file
2. **Right-click** on the file (or click the three-dot menu ⋮)
3. Select **Share**
4. Under **General access**, click on "Restricted"
5. Change to **Anyone with the link**
6. Make sure the role is set to **Viewer**
7. Click **Done**

**See Document 4, Step 2 for detailed instructions.**

---

### "I set sharing permissions but my audio still won't embed"

**Checklist:**
1. ☐ File is set to "Anyone with the link" (not Restricted)
2. ☐ Role is set to "Viewer" (not Editor or Commenter)
3. ☐ You copied the shareable link from Google Drive
4. ☐ You used Insert → Embed → By URL in Google Sites
5. ☐ You pasted the FULL link (starts with `https://drive.google.com/file/d/...`)
6. ☐ You published your Google Site after embedding

**Go through this checklist with the student to identify the issue.**

---

### "The embedded audio player shows 'No preview available'"

**Common causes:**
1. Sharing permissions are incorrect
2. The file format is wrong
3. The file is corrupted

**Solution:**
1. Go back to Google Drive
2. Try playing the file directly in Google Drive (double-click it)
   - If it won't play there, the file has an issue
3. Check sharing: Right-click → Share → verify "Anyone with the link"
4. Verify the file is WAV format (right-click → Details → Type should show "WAV audio")
5. If the file is corrupted, re-export from Cakewalk

---

### "I embedded the audio but it's not showing up on my site"

**Common causes:**
1. You didn't publish after embedding
2. The embed didn't process correctly
3. Browser cache is showing old version

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you clicked **Publish** after embedding
2. Try refreshing the page in edit mode
3. Delete the embed and try embedding again
4. Clear your browser cache or try in an incognito/private window
5. Try a different browser

---

### "How do I get the link to share/embed my audio?"

**Solution:**
1. In Google Drive, find your WAV file
2. Right-click the file → **Copy link** (or click Share → Copy link)
3. The link is now on your clipboard
4. Paste it into the Embed dialog in Google Sites

**The link should look like:**
`https://drive.google.com/file/d/[long string of characters]/view?usp=sharing`

---

### "Can I embed YouTube videos instead of Google Drive audio?"

**Yes, this is acceptable for DIS 1000.**

**How:**
1. Upload your audio to YouTube (create a simple video with a static image)
2. Set to Unlisted if you don't want it public
3. Copy the YouTube video URL
4. In Google Sites: Insert → Embed → By URL → Paste YouTube link

**Note:** Google Drive is simpler for audio-only files, but YouTube works if students prefer it.

---

## AI & Ideation Issues

### "I don't know how to use AI for ideation"

**This is covered in Document 1, but here's a quick guide:**

**Good approach:**
1. Start with what YOU'RE thinking: "I'm noticing [observation about the music]"
2. Ask the AI to help you explore: "What might this suggest? What am I missing?"
3. Push back on the AI's responses: "But what about...?"
4. Develop YOUR interpretation through dialogue

**Bad approach:**
- Asking AI to analyze something for you
- Copying AI responses directly
- Not doing your own thinking

**Redirect students to Document 1 for detailed guidance on this.**

---

### "The AI just gives me answers—how do I get it to ask ME questions?"

**Solution:**
1. Frame your prompt differently: "I'm thinking [your idea]. What questions should I consider?"
2. Ask explicitly: "Don't give me an analysis. Instead, ask me questions that will help me develop my thinking."
3. Use the Mollick framework:
   - **Context:** "I'm analyzing [song] for a class assignment..."
   - **Role:** "Act as a curious teacher who asks probing questions..."
   - **Interview:** "Help me explore my interpretation by asking questions..."

**Example prompt:**
> "I'm analyzing the structure of [song] and I think the bridge creates tension by introducing new harmonic material. Instead of telling me if I'm right, ask me questions that will help me explore this idea more deeply."

---

### "I'm not sure if I'm supposed to use AI for this assignment"

**Answer:**
- **Weeks 1-7:** AI use is **required** for brainstorming, refining ideas, and improving clarity
- **Weeks 8-15:** AI use is **encouraged** but optional

**What you CAN use AI for:**
- Brainstorming ideas
- Exploring alternative interpretations
- Refining your thinking
- Improving clarity of expression

**What you CANNOT do:**
- Ask AI to write your analysis for you
- Copy AI responses verbatim
- Use AI to bypass thinking

**See Document 1 for the full AI policy and guidance.**

---

## Library Research Issues (Artist Profile & CtM)

### "How do I contact Bryan Nicholls or set up a library appointment?"

**Bryan Nicholls Contact Information:**
- Email: bnicholls@highpoint.edu
- Phone: Check the library website for current number
- Office: Smith Library
- Online scheduling: Check the library website for booking system

**To set up an appointment:**
1. Email Bryan directly with your availability
2. Or check the library website for an online scheduling system
3. Mention you're from DIS 1000 and working on the Artist Profile (or Connection to Your Major)

**If Bryan is not available:**
- Any reference librarian can help with music research
- Use the library's "Ask a Librarian" service
- Try the live chat feature on the library website

---

### "The library is fully booked / I can't get an appointment in time"

**Options:**
1. Use the library's live chat service (available on the library website)
   - You can get research help in real-time
   - Document the chat conversation (screenshot)
2. Email a reference librarian with your research question
   - They can respond with suggestions and resources
   - Document the email exchange
3. Visit the library reference desk during open hours
   - Librarians are available for walk-in questions
   - Ask for a business card or photo

**Important:** Plan ahead! Don't wait until the day before the assignment is due to contact the library.

---

### "I can't find enough sources about my artist"

**Try these strategies:**

**1. Use library databases:**
- Music Index
- Academic Search Complete
- JSTOR (for academic articles)
- ProQuest (for magazine and newspaper articles)

**2. Expand your search terms:**
- Try the artist's real name (not stage name)
- Try genre terms (if searching for hip-hop artist, also search "hip hop" + "1990s" etc.)
- Use AI to generate keyword suggestions: "What search terms should I use to find sources about [artist]?"

**3. Use the Amazon → Library catalog trick:**
- Search amazon.com for books about your artist
- Note the ISBN
- Search your library catalog using that ISBN
- See if the library has it or can get it

**4. Check Wikipedia strategically:**
- Don't cite Wikipedia itself
- Scroll to the bottom and look at the "References" section
- Those are the original sources - track those down and use them

**5. Broaden slightly:**
- If your artist has very few sources, look for sources about their genre, era, or influences
- Find sources that mention your artist alongside others

**If you've tried all this and still can't find sources:** Talk to Mr. Turner about adjusting your topic.

---

### "How do I cite this source in Chicago format?"

**Step 1: Identify what type of source it is**
- Book
- Magazine/journal article
- Website
- Interview (print, video, podcast)
- Album review
- Etc.

**Step 2: Use the Chicago Style Citation Guide**
- https://guides.highpoint.edu/chicagomanual
- Find the section for your source type
- Follow the format exactly

**Step 3: If using AI for help**
- You can ask: "How do I cite a YouTube interview in Chicago Notes-Bibliography format?"
- AI can explain the general structure
- BUT you must verify against the official guide

**Step 4: If using a citation generator (not recommended)**
- Generate the citation
- **Do NOT just copy and paste it**
- Check it against the Chicago guide and correct any errors
- You're responsible for accuracy, not the generator

**Common mistakes to watch for:**
- Capitalization (titles should be in title case)
- Punctuation (commas, periods, quotation marks in specific places)
- Author names (Last name, First name format)
- Hanging indent for bibliography entries

**Remember:** The assignment requires you to engage with the citation guide, not just outsource to a generator.

---

### "Can I use Google for my research?"

**Yes, but strategically:**

**Google is fine for:**
- Initial exploration and overview
- Finding official artist websites or social media
- Discovering what's out there

**But also use library resources:**
- Library databases have credible, peer-reviewed sources
- Trade publications accessible through library subscriptions
- Books and academic articles not available via Google

**The goal:** Learn to use library resources, not just rely on Google. You'll need these skills for Connection to Your Major and future courses.

---

### "Wikipedia says not to cite it - so can I use it at all?"

**Yes, but strategically:**

**What Wikipedia is good for:**
- Getting a general overview of your artist
- Understanding their career trajectory
- Finding potential angles for your research

**How to use it correctly:**
1. Read the Wikipedia article
2. Scroll to the bottom and look at "References" or "External links"
3. Click on those sources and read the original articles/books
4. **Cite the original sources, not Wikipedia**

**Why this works:**
- Wikipedia articles are written using sources
- Those sources are usually credible
- You're using Wikipedia as a finding tool, not a final source

**What NOT to do:**
- Copy information from Wikipedia and cite it
- Treat Wikipedia as an authoritative source
- Ignore the original sources

---

### "My computer is too slow to run Cakewalk"

**Short-term solutions:**
1. Close all other programs
2. Work with fewer tracks
3. Reduce effects usage
4. Save and restart frequently

**Long-term solutions:**
- Use a computer in the lab
- Borrow a better computer if possible
- Consider whether the student's machine meets minimum requirements

**If the computer genuinely can't run Cakewalk:** Escalate to the instructor—they may need to make alternative arrangements.

---

### "My internet is too slow to upload files"

**Solutions:**
1. Use campus Wi-Fi (usually faster)
2. Upload during off-peak hours (late night/early morning)
3. Compress the file if absolutely necessary (but this may affect quality)
4. Start uploading well before the deadline

**Prevention:** Don't wait until the last minute to upload. Start early so slow internet doesn't cause you to miss the deadline.

---

### "I accidentally closed/deleted something and lost my work"

**For Cakewalk projects:**
- Check if you saved recently (File → Open Recent)
- Look in your project folder for auto-saves or backup files
- If not saved: Unfortunately, the work may be lost

**For Google Sites:**
- Google Sites auto-saves—refresh the page and your work should reappear
- Check the version history (three dots menu → Version history)

**For Google Drive:**
- Check the Trash folder—deleted files stay there for 30 days
- Right-click → Restore to recover deleted files

**Prevention:** Save frequently! In Cakewalk, press Ctrl+S every few minutes. Google Sites auto-saves, but publish frequently.

---

### "Everything was working and now suddenly it's not"

**General troubleshooting steps:**
1. Restart the program (Cakewalk, browser, etc.)
2. Restart the computer
3. Check internet connection (for cloud-based tools)
4. Try a different browser (for Google Sites/Drive)
5. Clear browser cache
6. Check if there's a known outage (Google Workspace status page)

**If still not working:** Document what exactly isn't working and escalate to instructor or IT support.

---

## Assignment-Specific Questions

### "What counts as a 'sound composition' vs. a 'texture composition'?"

**This is a conceptual question—redirect to instructor.**

**But you can help with the technical side:**
- **Sound Composition (Week 1):** Focus on exploring timbres (qualities of sounds)
  - Use varied instruments, effects, experimental sounds
- **Texture Composition (Week 2):** Focus on how many things are happening at once
  - Create contrasts: sparse sections (1-2 instruments) vs. dense sections (many instruments)

---

### "How long should my composition be?"

**Check the assignment instructions—this varies.**

**General guidance for most assignments:**
- Aim for 1-3 minutes
- Long enough to demonstrate the concept
- Not so long that you run out of ideas

**If the assignment doesn't specify:** Suggest 2 minutes as a reasonable target.

---

### "Do I need to record live instruments or can I use loops?"

**Answer:** You can use loops! This course is not about recording live performance.

**Using BandLab loops and virtual instruments is completely acceptable and expected.**

**Students should focus on:**
- Creative arrangement
- Understanding musical concepts
- Making thoughtful choices about sounds and structure

**Not on:**
- Recording live performances
- Advanced music production techniques

---

### "I don't have any musical experience—can I still do this?"

**Reassure them:** No prior musical experience is required!

**The course is designed for:**
- Learning through doing
- Experimentation
- Exploring ideas, not performing perfectly

**Technical help you can provide:**
- Show them how to browse and use loops
- Help them understand the interface
- Guide them through the export/upload process

**Creative guidance:** Redirect to instructor for questions about artistic choices.

---

## When to Escalate to Instructor

The teaching assistant handles **technical** questions. Escalate to the instructor for:

### Conceptual/Creative Questions
- "I don't understand what the assignment is asking for"
- "Is my composition good enough?"
- "What does 'timbre' mean?"
- "How do I analyze this song?"

### Grading Questions
- "Why did I get this grade?"
- "Can I redo this assignment?"
- "Will this late submission be accepted?"

### Policy Questions
- "Can I have an extension?"
- "I was absent—what did I miss?"
- "Do I have to use AI?"

### Severe Technical Issues
- Computer completely unable to run Cakewalk
- Persistent issues after trying all troubleshooting steps
- Campus IT-level problems

---

## Final Tips for Teaching Assistant

### Start with "Have you tried..."

When students ask for help, often they haven't tried the obvious first step.

**Good questions to ask first:**
- "Have you tried restarting the program?"
- "Have you published your site after making changes?"
- "Did you check the sharing permissions on your Google Drive file?"
- "Have you looked at the model site to see how it's organized?"

### Walk Through Step-by-Step

Don't just tell students "set sharing permissions"—walk them through it:
1. "Open Google Drive"
2. "Find your file"
3. "Right-click on it"
4. "Click Share"
5. Etc.

### Test Your Solutions

If you're not sure if a solution will work, test it yourself first:
- Try uploading a file to Google Drive
- Practice embedding in a test Google Site
- Export a sample from Cakewalk

### Be Patient

Many students have never:
- Used a DAW before
- Created a website
- Used AI for ideation

**Things that seem obvious to you may be completely new to them.**

**Remember:** They're learning both technology AND course content simultaneously.

### Encourage Early Work

When students ask questions late in the evening before a deadline, remind them gently:
- "For future assignments, try to start earlier so you have time to troubleshoot"
- "Upload and embed as soon as you export—don't wait"

### Celebrate Progress

When a student successfully embeds their first audio file or exports their first composition:
- "Great job! You've got the workflow down now"
- "That sounded good! The export process gets easier each time"

**Positive reinforcement helps students feel capable and confident.**

## Quick Reference: Most Common Issues

**Top 5 Issues Students Will Encounter:**

1. **Forgot to publish Google Site after making changes**
   - Solution: Click Publish button!

2. **Google Drive file not set to "Anyone with the link"**
   - Solution: Right-click → Share → Anyone with the link → Viewer

3. **Can't find exported WAV file**
   - Solution: Check project folder, search computer for *.wav

4. **Don't know how to embed audio**
   - Solution: Insert → Embed → By URL → paste Google Drive link

5. **Asking AI to write analysis instead of developing own thinking**
   - Solution: Redirect to Document 1 for AI ideation guidance

**If you can help students avoid these 5 issues, you'll prevent 80% of the problems!**
