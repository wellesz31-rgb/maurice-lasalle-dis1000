# Connection to Your Major (Weeks 12-15)
## DIS 1000 Teaching Assistant Knowledge Base

---

## Overview: The Connection to Your Major Unit

**Weeks 12-15** focus on a scaffolded research and writing project that connects music to students' chosen majors.

**Course Learning Outcome:** Synthesize concepts, theories, or frameworks of fields of study and apply them to situations or problems (Integrative Learning).

**What makes this unit different:**
- Individual work (no longer working in teams)
- Sustained focus on a single project over 4 weeks
- Required engagement with campus support services (major faculty, research librarian, writing center)
- Professional presentation as final exam
- Explicitly honors and supports students' own goals and passions

**Key point:** This is NOT just "write a research paper." It's about building a professional network, practicing self-advocacy, undoing learned helplessness, and demonstrating that gen ed courses foster transferable skills.

---

## The Pedagogical Approach: Beyond the Research Paper

### Why Connection to Major?

**Problems this assignment addresses:**

1. **Learned Helplessness:** Many students arrive from high school believing they can't do research, can't write, can't connect with faculty
2. **Gen Ed Resentment:** Students often see gen ed courses as "throwaway" requirements unrelated to their actual goals
3. **Isolation:** Freshmen haven't yet built relationships with faculty, librarians, or support services
4. **Passive Learning:** Students wait to be told what to do rather than advocating for themselves

**This assignment forces active engagement:**
- Students must initiate contact with faculty in their major
- Students must work with research librarians
- Students must use the writing center
- Students must make professional connections and invitations
- Students must present their work publicly in business-casual attire

**From the instructor:**
> "I am really sick of colleagues in the Humanities who sneer at the business majors."

**Translation:** This assignment honors ALL majors equally. Music marketing, music therapy, cybersecurity, physics, business, nursing - all are valid and interesting connections to explore.

### The Transferable Skills

By the end of this unit, students will have practiced:
- **Research skills:** Finding, evaluating, and synthesizing sources
- **Professional networking:** Reaching out to faculty, making appointments, asking informed questions
- **Academic support:** Using librarians and writing center consultants effectively
- **Synthetic thinking:** Connecting disparate ideas rather than just summarizing
- **Professional presentation:** Delivering elevator pitches, fielding questions, dressing appropriately
- **Written communication:** Structuring arguments, citing sources, revising based on feedback

**These skills transfer to internships, job searches, graduate school applications, and careers.**

## The Scaffolded Process (Weeks 12-15)

### Week 12: Topic, Bibliography, and Faculty Visit

**Assignment: CtM: Topic and Bibliography (10 points)**

**What students must do:**

1. **Choose a topic** that connects music to their major
   - Must represent both music AND their field of study
   - Can be any overlap, as long as both are present
   - Examples:
     * Music Marketing: Streaming platform algorithms and brand identity
     * Music Therapy: Neurological effects of music on trauma recovery
     * Cybersecurity: PII data mining from music streaming platforms
     * Physics: Acoustics and sound wave propagation
     * Business: Music festival logistics and event management
     * Nursing: Music's role in pain management protocols

2. **Begin gathering sources** for a bibliography
   - Academic sources preferred (journal articles, books)
   - Can include credible online sources
   - Should represent diverse perspectives on the topic

3. **Visit a faculty member in their major**
   - Must happen during office hours
   - Students should introduce themselves
   - Ask questions about the major, internships, research, graduate school, employment
   - **Then ask about connections with music**
   - Document the visit with a photo or signed business card

**Deliverable:**
- Create a new page on Google Site titled "Connection to Your Major"
- Upload photo or scanned business card from faculty visit
- Post initial topic and working bibliography

**Using AI for Topic Selection:**
- Use AI to brainstorm potential connections between your major and music
- Ask: "What are some ways music intersects with [your major]?"
- Explore multiple possibilities before committing
- The AI can help identify angles you hadn't considered
- BUT: The final topic choice should reflect YOUR genuine interest

---

### Week 13: Mind Map and Librarian Visit

**Assignment: CtM: Mind Map (10 points)**

**Purpose:** Avoid writing a series of summaries. Instead, create a visual representation of how your sources connect to each other and to your central topic.

**What students must do:**

1. **Create a mind map** (by hand or using software)
   - Create a "node" for each source
   - List key concepts and takeaways from each source around the nodes
   - **Draw lines connecting ideas and concepts** (this is the critical part!)
   - Look for themes, contradictions, supporting evidence, cause-and-effect relationships

2. **Review the map and identify 3-5 points to make in the essay**
   - What patterns emerge from the connections?
   - What argument or insights do the sources collectively support?
   - What's missing that you need to research further?

3. **Arrange into a bulleted list**
   - Include specific examples/evidence from your sources
   - This becomes the skeleton of your essay

4. **Visit the research librarian**
   - Get help finding additional sources
   - Learn about databases in your field
   - Ask about citation management tools
   - Document the visit

**Deliverable:**
- Embed your mind map to your CtM page
- Include the bulleted list of 3-5 points with supporting evidence

**Mind Map Tools:**
- Hand-drawn (encouraged! - helps with visual thinking)
- Digital tools: Coggle, MindMeister, Miro, Lucidchart
- Even a Google Doc with lines/arrows drawn in works fine

**Using AI for Mind Mapping:**
- After creating your mind map, you can ask AI: "I've identified these connections between sources - what patterns do you see? What am I missing?"
- Use AI to help articulate the relationships between ideas
- BUT: The synthesis of sources into key points must be YOUR thinking, not AI's summary

**Why Mind Mapping Matters:**
This prevents the classic mistake of writing: "Source A says X. Source B says Y. Source C says Z."

Instead, you're writing: "Three researchers found evidence of X, though they disagree about the mechanism (Sources A, B, C). This suggests that Y might be true, which has implications for Z."

**The difference:** Summary vs. synthesis. Listing vs. arguing.

---

### Week 14: Free-Written Draft and Peer Review

**Assignment: CtM: Free-written Draft (10 points)**

**Purpose:** Overcome perfectionism, generate raw material, get ideas flowing without self-censorship.

**The Setup:**
Mr. Turner will talk about his Swiss pencils with no erasers - physical constraints that force forward momentum.

**What students must do:**

**Before Friday's class:**
- Review your list of 3-5 points from the mind map
- Workshop the order of points
- Fill in any missing information from sources
- **Do NOT write the essay yet**

**Friday in class: The Free-Write Exercise (10 minutes)**

1. **Write a first draft by hand or on computer**
   - Target: 600-800 words
   - Synthesize your research into a cohesive essay
   - Write it in one sitting
   - **Make no corrections or edits as you go**
   - **Don't stop writing until the essay is finished**
   - Let it be bad - you'll fix it later

**The rule:** No stopping, no editing, no erasing. Just keep writing forward.

**Why this works:**
- Perfectionism is the enemy of completion
- First drafts are always bad - that's what revision is for
- Getting SOMETHING on paper is better than staring at a blank page
- The act of continuous writing often surfaces insights you didn't know you had

**After the free-write: Peer Review**

Students exchange drafts in small groups and answer:
1. What is the best idea, and where in the draft does it occur?
2. What is the best sentence?
3. What other information seems to be missing?

**Deliverable:**
- Turn in physical copy to Mr. Turner OR
- Scan and embed to your CtM page

**Using AI After the Free-Write:**
- You can ask AI to identify the strongest ideas in your rough draft
- You can ask AI where your argument is unclear or needs development
- BUT: Do NOT ask AI to rewrite your draft. The thinking and structure should remain yours.

---

### Week 15: Second Draft, Writing Center Visit, and Final Draft

**Assignment: CtM: Second Draft (10 points)**

**What students must do:**

1. **Revise your work into a second draft**
   - Reshape according to peer review feedback
   - Incorporate Mr. Turner's comments
   - Add footnotes (Chicago Notes-Bibliography format)
   - Include Bibliography (properly formatted with hanging indent)

2. **Visit the Writing Center**
   - Bring your second draft
   - Work with a consultant on clarity, organization, citations
   - Document the visit with a photo or signed business card
   - **This earns additional pass credit**

3. **Post the second draft**
   - Link or embed the Google Doc to your CtM page
   - Make sure the document is set to "public" (or "anyone with the link")

**Deliverable:**
- Second draft on CtM page
- Photo/business card from Writing Center visit

**Using AI for Revision:**
- AI is excellent for improving clarity and polish
- You can ask: "How can I make this paragraph clearer?"
- You can ask: "Is this transition between paragraphs smooth?"
- You can use AI to check grammar, fix awkward phrasing, improve flow
- BUT: The ideas, argument structure, and synthesis must remain yours
- The Writing Center visit is still required - AI and human consultants serve complementary purposes

**Why Both AI and Writing Center?**
- AI is fast and always available - great for quick clarity checks
- Writing Center consultants understand assignment context and can ask probing questions
- AI can polish prose; humans can challenge your thinking
- Learning to use both tools appropriately is a transferable skill

---

### Final Draft (50 points)

**Assignment: CtM: Final Draft**

**What students must do:**

Produce a polished, 600-800 word essay that:
- Connects music to your major in a meaningful way
- Synthesizes research from multiple sources
- Makes an argument or presents insights (not just summary)
- Uses Chicago Notes-Bibliography citation format correctly
- Demonstrates clear organization and strong writing

**See "Essay Guidelines" section below for detailed requirements.**

**Deliverable:**
- Final draft embedded on CtM page
- Properly cited with footnotes and bibliography

---

## Essay Guidelines

### Introduction Strategies

Your introduction should accomplish three key tasks:

**1. Hook your reader with an engaging opening**
- Start with a surprising fact about music in your field
- Open with a relevant quote from your research
- Describe a specific scenario where music and your field intersect

**2. Provide necessary context**
- Brief background on the relationship between music and your field
- Why this intersection matters

**3. Present your main focus/argument**
- Clear statement of your specific area of investigation
- Preview of your key points

---

### Building Strong Body Paragraphs

- Begin each paragraph with a clear topic sentence
- Support claims with specific evidence from your sources
- Use transitions to connect ideas between paragraphs
- Integrate quotes smoothly, explaining their significance
- Remember to cite sources using Chicago Notes-Bibliography format

---

### Writing Effective Conclusions

Your conclusion should:

**1. Synthesize (don't just summarize) your main points**
- What do these connections mean collectively?
- What insights emerged from bringing these ideas together?

**2. Connect back to your introduction in a meaningful way**
- Return to your hook with new understanding
- Show how your investigation answered or complicated your initial question

**3. Look forward**
- Discuss implications for your field
- Consider future developments
- **Reflect on your potential role in this intersection** (you may use first person here)

**4. End with impact**
- Return to your "hook" with new insight
- Pose a thought-provoking question
- Call to action or reflection

---

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don't introduce new evidence in your conclusion
- Avoid generic phrases like "In conclusion" or "Throughout history"
- Don't end with a general statement that could apply to any paper
- ☠ **Forbidden words:** "heavily," "greatly," "prevalent" (these are vague and overused)

---

### Voice and Perspective

**Use active voice whenever possible:**

❌ "The connection between music and physics was studied..."
✓ "Scientists studied the connection between music and physics..."

**Write in third person perspective:**

❌ "When you analyze the frequency patterns..."
❌ "I discovered that music therapy..."
✓ "Analysis of the frequency patterns shows..."
✓ "Research demonstrates that music therapy..."

**Exception:** You may use first person in the conclusion when discussing your potential future role in the field.

---

### Sample Transitions

**For Body Paragraphs:**
- Building on this foundation...
- This intersection becomes even more significant when...
- While [previous point] focuses on [X], equally important is...
- This development naturally led to...

**For the Conclusion:**
- Having examined these connections...
- These findings suggest...
- Looking ahead...
- The implications of this relationship extend beyond...

---

## Using AI Throughout the CtM Process

### The Philosophy: AI as a Tool, Not a Shortcut

**From the instructor's perspective:**
The incorporation of AI into writing is like the incorporation of calculators into math - it allows us to focus on higher-level thinking (conceptual understanding) rather than mechanical execution (computation/grammar).

**AI can drastically improve writing quality** when used appropriately:
- Students can focus on developing better ideas
- Mechanical polish (grammar, clarity, flow) can be offloaded to tools
- More time for synthesis and original thinking

**But AI cannot replace thinking:**
- The connections you make between music and your major must be YOUR insights
- The synthesis of sources must reflect YOUR understanding
- The argument structure must be YOUR organizational choice

### Appropriate Uses of AI for CtM

**During Topic Selection:**
- "What are interesting intersections between music and [your major]?"
- "I'm interested in [topic] - what specific angles could I explore?"
- "Which of these three topic ideas seems most promising and why?"

**During Research/Mind Mapping:**
- "I've found these sources - what patterns or themes do you see?"
- "How do these three researchers' findings relate to each other?"
- "What questions should I be asking about this connection?"

**During Free-Writing:**
- DON'T use AI during the actual free-write exercise
- The free-write is about YOUR unfiltered thinking

**After Free-Writing:**
- "What's the strongest idea in this draft?"
- "Where is my argument unclear?"
- "What evidence seems to be missing?"

**During Revision:**
- "How can I make this sentence clearer?"
- "Is this transition between paragraphs smooth?"
- "How can I better integrate this quote?"
- "Check this paragraph for grammar and clarity"

**For Citations:**
- "How do I format this source in Chicago Notes-Bibliography style?"
- "Is my bibliography formatted correctly?"

### Inappropriate Uses of AI for CtM

**DON'T:**
- Ask AI to write the essay for you ("Write an essay about music and cybersecurity")
- Copy-paste AI responses without thinking about them
- Use AI to avoid engaging with your sources
- Let AI make your argument for you
- Replace the Writing Center visit with AI

**Why these are problems:**
- You learn nothing from having AI do the work
- AI doesn't know your specific sources or assignment context
- The goal is to develop YOUR ability to think synthetically
- Human consultants can challenge your thinking in ways AI cannot

### The Balance: Tools Working Together

**Think of your support system as:**

**AI:** Fast, always available, great for clarity and polish
- Use for quick grammar checks
- Use for brainstorming and exploration
- Use for understanding citation formats

**Research Librarian:** Expert in finding and evaluating sources
- Use for discovering databases and resources
- Use for search strategies
- Use for understanding scholarly vs. popular sources

**Writing Center:** Expert in argumentation and organization
- Use for feedback on structure
- Use for developing clearer arguments
- Use for understanding assignment expectations

**Faculty in Your Major:** Expert in your field's conventions and current issues
- Use for understanding what matters in your discipline
- Use for career advice and networking
- Use for validating your topic's relevance

**All of these tools are available. Learning to use them effectively is part of what you're learning in DIS 1000.**

## The Virtual Poster Session (Final Exam)

### Overview

Instead of a traditional final exam, DIS 1000 culminates in a **Virtual Poster Session** where students present their CtM work in a professional setting.

**Date:** Tuesday, April 28, 3:30 PM (per syllabus)

**Format:**
- Students stand next to their laptops showing their Google Sites
- Dressed in business-casual attire
- Deliver 90-second elevator pitches
- Answer questions about their research and the course

**Purpose:**
- Practice professional presentation skills
- Demonstrate learning to invited guests
- Network with faculty, staff, and campus professionals
- Celebrate accomplishments

---

### The Elevator Pitch (STAR Method)

**Week 15, Monday: Write and Practice the Pitch**

Students prepare a 90-second elevator pitch using the STAR method:

**S - Situation**
- Brief context of your major/field
- Initial connection point with music

**T - Task**
- What specific aspect of music in your field did you investigate?
- Why is this intersection significant?

**A - Action**
- What research methods did you use?
- Key discoveries from your investigation
- Most interesting connection you found

**R - Result**
- Implications for your field
- How this connects to your future goals
- Call to action or thought-provoking conclusion

**In-Class Practice:**
- Small groups of 3-4 students
- Each student gives their pitch (90 seconds)
- Receive peer feedback (90 seconds)
- Take 60 seconds for self-reflection (what went well, what needs work)

---

### Invitations

**Students must invite guests to attend the poster session.**

**Who to invite:**
- Faculty member from your major (whom you visited)
- Research librarian (whom you worked with)
- Writing Center consultant (whom you worked with)
- Career and Professional Development staff
- Academic advisor
- Team members from the earlier teamwork unit (if desired)
- Any other relevant faculty or staff

**Strategy:**
- Mr. Turner encourages students to invite **at least 5 people**
- Expect no-shows - the more people you invite, the more likely someone will come
- **Don't forget staff** - they're often eager to attend and support students

**Mr. Turner provides:**
- Email templates for invitations
- Reminder email templates
- Thank-you note templates

**Timing:**
- Send invitations 1-2 weeks before the poster session
- Send reminder 2-3 days before
- Send thank-you notes within a week after

---

### The Day Of: Poster Session Logistics

**Setup:**
- Arrive early to set up your laptop
- Have your Google Site open to your CtM page

**What to expect:**
- Faculty, staff, administrators may attend
- Other students will be presenting nearby
- Some invited guests may not be able to attend (finals week is busy)
- Mr. Turner will circulate and may bring visitors to your station

---

### Business-Casual Attire

**What this means:**
- Clean, neat, professional appearance
- Slightly more formal than everyday campus wear
- Less formal than a job interview suit

**Examples:**
- Slacks or khakis with a collared shirt or blouse
- Dress or skirt with appropriate top
- Sweater or blazer over professional clothing
- Clean, closed-toe shoes

**Not appropriate:**
- T-shirts, hoodies, athletic wear
- Ripped jeans or shorts
- Flip-flops or sneakers
- Extremely casual or revealing clothing

**Why this matters:**
- Practice presenting yourself professionally
- Show respect for your guests' time
- Build confidence in professional settings
- This is what professional conferences look like

---

## Common Student Questions About CtM

### "How do I choose a topic?"

**Good approach:**
1. Think about what genuinely interests you in your major
2. Brainstorm ways music might connect (use AI for this if needed)
3. Choose the intersection that seems most interesting or surprising
4. Make sure both music AND your major are substantially represented

**Topics that work well:**
- Specific, focused intersections (not too broad)
- Connections you're genuinely curious about
- Topics where you can find academic sources

**Topics that don't work well:**
- Too broad ("music and business" - narrow it down!)
- Superficial connections ("nurses should play music for patients" - dig deeper into mechanisms)
- Topics with no available sources

### "What if I can't find enough sources?"

**Solutions:**
1. Visit the research librarian - they're experts at finding sources
2. Broaden your search terms slightly
3. Look at sources in adjacent fields
4. Consider whether your topic is too narrow or too recent

**The librarian can help you:**
- Find databases specific to your field
- Develop effective search strategies
- Evaluate source credibility
- Use citation management tools

### "I'm nervous about contacting a faculty member in my major"

**This is normal! Here's how to make it less intimidating:**

**Finding faculty:**
1. Look at your major's department website
2. Read faculty bios to find someone whose research interests you
3. Check office hours (usually posted on website or office door)

**Making contact:**
- Email first if that feels more comfortable: "Hi Dr. [Name], I'm a freshman in DIS 1000 working on a project about [your major]. Could I visit during office hours to ask some questions?"
- Show up during office hours (that's what they're for!)
- Bring your initial topic idea and be ready to ask questions

**What to say:**
1. Introduce yourself: "Hi, I'm [Name], a freshman thinking about majoring in [field]"
2. Explain why you're there: "I'm working on a project connecting music to my major and wanted to ask some questions"
3. Ask your questions: About the major, internships, research opportunities, graduate school, careers
4. Ask about music connections: "Do you see any ways music intersects with [your field]?"
5. Thank them and ask for a photo or business card

**Remember:** 
- Faculty WANT students to come to office hours. You're not bothering them - you're doing exactly what they hope students will do. 
- In the unlikely event that the faculty member is rude or dismissive, this is also valuable information - you may not be a good fit for their classes or advising style later on.

### "What if the Writing Center wants to change things I don't agree with?"

**Important:** Writing Center consultants make suggestions, not demands.

**You are the author:**
- You can choose which feedback to incorporate
- You can explain your reasoning and discuss alternatives
- You can disagree respectfully

**But also:**
- Take their suggestions seriously - they're trained in academic writing
- If they point out unclear passages, your reader probably will be confused too
- If they suggest reorganization, consider why they think that would help

**The goal:** Improve your writing through dialogue, not just follow orders.

### "Can I use AI to write the whole essay and then just edit it?"

**No. Here's why:**

**What you'd lose:**
- The learning - you'd have no idea how to write the next paper
- Your own thinking - AI doesn't know your sources or your unique insights
- The grade - Mr. Turner can tell when students copy AI responses

**What happens instead:**
- You learn nothing about synthesis or argumentation
- You don't develop writing skills you'll need for your major
- You miss the point of the assignment entirely

**Use AI as a tool to enhance YOUR work, not to replace YOUR thinking.**

### "How formal should this essay be?"

**Answer:** Academic but accessible.

**This means:**
- Third person perspective (with exception for conclusion)
- Proper citations
- Clear, organized structure
- No slang or overly casual language

**But NOT:**
- Stuffy, overcomplicated prose
- Jargon for jargon's sake
- Overly complex sentence structures
- Trying to "sound smart" at the expense of clarity

**Good rule:** Write clearly enough that a smart person outside your field could follow your argument.

### "What if I don't get any responses to my poster session invitations?"

**This is common - don't panic!**

**Strategies:**
1. Invite MORE people (5+ increases odds someone will come)
2. Send reminder emails 2-3 days before
3. Accept that finals week is extremely busy
4. Focus on giving a great pitch to whoever does attend
5. Remember: Your classmates and Mr. Turner will be there

**Important:** Your grade is not dependent on how many guests show up. It's dependent on your preparation and presentation.

## When to Escalate to Instructor

The teaching assistant handles **technical and logistical questions**. Escalate to instructor for:

### Content/Quality Questions
- "Is my topic good enough?"
- "Does my argument make sense?"
- "Is this the right kind of source?"
- "What grade do you think this will get?"

### Faculty/Staff Issues
- "The faculty member I contacted never responded"
- "The Writing Center is booked - what should I do?"
- Problems with any required visit

### Extension/Policy Questions
- "Can I have more time?"
- "I missed a deadline - what are my options?"
- "Can I change my topic at this stage?"

### Conceptual Confusion
- "I don't understand what 'synthesis' means"
- "What's the difference between this and a summary?"
- "How do I make an argument vs. just presenting information?"

---

## Tips for Teaching Assistant

### Encourage Self-Advocacy

When students ask: "Can you email the librarian for me?"

**Response:** "Part of this assignment is practicing reaching out to people professionally. I can help you draft the email if you'd like, but you should send it."

**Why:** The point is for THEM to build confidence in professional communication.

---

### Validate the Challenge

**This is a complex, sustained project:**
- "It's normal to feel overwhelmed - you're juggling a lot of moving parts"
- "The scaffolding is designed to break it into manageable pieces"
- "You don't have to do it all at once"

---

### Reinforce the Network-Building Purpose

**When students complain about required visits:**
- "These aren't just hoops to jump through - you're building relationships you'll need later"
- "Knowing your major's faculty now will help when you need recommendation letters"
- "Learning to use the library and writing center now saves time on future papers"

---

### Emphasize Process Over Perfection

**When students are paralyzed by perfectionism:**
- "Remember the free-write exercise - the goal is to get something down, not to get it perfect"
- "Revision is where good writing happens - first drafts are supposed to be rough"
- "You can't edit a blank page"

---

### Celebrate Progress

**When students complete required visits or submit drafts:**
- "Great job taking initiative to contact that faculty member!"
- "I love that your mind map shows actual connections, not just a list"
- "Your elevator pitch is really coming together"

---
