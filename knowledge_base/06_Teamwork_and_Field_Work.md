# Teamwork & Field Work (Weeks 8-11)
## DIS 1000 Teaching Assistant Knowledge Base

---

## Overview: The Teamwork Unit

**Weeks 8-11** shift from individual studio work to collaborative field work. Students form teams and work together on four major projects while competing for rewards in a semester-long game.

**Course Learning Outcome:** Demonstrate the ability to operate in a constructive team environment.

**What makes this unit different:**
- Students work in teams of 4-6
- All work is collaborative and "branded" with team identity
- Teams compete for Monopoly money and privileges
- Individual grades based on demonstrated contributions
- Heavy emphasis on social identity and group cohesion

**Key Insight:** This isn't just "group work." It's a carefully designed system using social identity theory to build genuine team effectiveness.

---

## The Pedagogical Approach: Social Identity Theory

### The Teamwork Unit Motto

**Core Principle:**
> Teamwork is not dividing a task into smaller components and assigning them to different group members, although this may be involved. Rather, teamwork is about knowledge or value creation through collaboration and synthesis.

**Unit Objective:**
The purpose of this unit is to learn to work effectively in diverse teams to create innovative solutions, leverage individual strengths, practice empathy, and engage in reflective processes to enhance both the project outcome and personal growth in professional collaboration skills.

**What this means in practice:** Teams should be creating something together that's better than what any individual could create alone. The whole should be greater than the sum of its parts.

### Why Teams Work (Or Don't)

Most group work in education fails because:
- Students form friendship groups (homogeneous, conflict-avoidant)
- There's no shared identity beyond "we're in the same group"
- Individual accountability is weak
- There's no incentive for engagement
- Work is divided rather than synthesized

### This Course's Approach

The DIS 1000 teamwork unit deliberately creates conditions for effective collaboration:

1. **Forced Diversity:** Teams must include at least 3 different temperaments and specific skill sets
2. **Identity Overload:** Tartan, theme song, callback, mission statement, NATO name
3. **Competition:** Teams compete against each other for tangible rewards
4. **Individual Accountability:** Color-coded contributions and peer evaluations
5. **Economic Incentives:** Monopoly money economy rewards participation and success

**The Goal:** Leverage social identity (us vs. them) to enhance group effectiveness, not just to make students work together.

### Instructor's Philosophy

From Mr. Turner:
> "If you do my job right, the groups are a little difficult to get back apart."

**Translation:** By Week 12 (after the game ends), students should have genuine team bonds, not just tolerate each other.

---

## Team Formation Process (Week 8)

### Step 1: Self-Awareness (5 minutes)

Students take the **Four Temperaments Test** to identify their working style:

**The Four Temperaments:**
- **Sanguine (The Enthusiast):** Energetic, spontaneous, distractible
- **Choleric (The Driver):** Ambitious, assertive, domineering
- **Melancholic (The Analyst):** Detail-oriented, cautious, critical
- **Phlegmatic (The Harmonizer):** Steady, diplomatic, passive

**Purpose:** Not to pigeonhole students, but to make them aware of different working styles and the need for diverse teams.

### Step 2: Speed Dating (30 minutes)

Students circulate the room, talking to different people for 90-second intervals.

**Goal:** Find 4-6 potential team candidates who:
- Represent at least 3 different temperaments
- Answer "yes" to at least 2 of the following skills:
  * Loves organizing chaos
  * Has experience performing music
  * Enjoys interviewing strangers
  * Is comfortable using spreadsheets
  * Prefers leading from behind
  * Has bold aesthetic taste

**Rules:**
- Must rotate every 90 seconds (no exceptions)
- Cannot stay with friends
- Focus on temperaments and skills, not specific individuals

**Instructor's emphasis:** "You are not forming friend groups. You are assembling a functioning organism. Choose accordingly."

### Step 3: Team Proposals (10 minutes)

**Open Negotiation (5 minutes):**
- Students discuss and negotiate with their candidates
- Goal: Form balanced teams of approximately 4 students each
- Typically results in 6 teams per class

**Group Finalization (5 minutes):**
- Teams report their membership to Mr. Turner
- Must demonstrate 3 different temperaments represented
- Instructor assigns team names using NATO phonetic alphabet (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot)

**Why NATO names?** Removes personality associations or hierarchy - all names are functionally equivalent.

### Step 4: Team Branding

Every team must create:

1. **A Tartan:** Choose a tartan pattern (from online resources)
   - Represents team colors and visual identity
   - Used throughout branded materials

2. **A Theme Song:** Select a song that represents the team
   - Can be anything (popular song, meme song, classical piece)
   - Instructor plays it during class - team must stand and acknowledge
   - Failure to respond = $1 fine

3. **A Callback:** Create a call-and-response phrase
   - Instructor calls, team responds in unison
   - Examples range from simple ("Alpha!" "Ready!") to elaborate
   - Failure to respond = $1 fine

4. **A Mission Statement:** Write a team mission (maximum 50 words)
   - Articulates team values or goals
   - Should be somewhat aspirational or humorous

**Documentation:**
- All branding goes in the team's shared Google Doc
- Must include: tartan, theme song, callback, team photo, mission statement
- Instructor provides a Google Doc template for each team (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, etc.)

## The Monopoly Money Economy

### How the Economy Works

Teams compete for Monopoly money throughout Weeks 8-11. The team with the most money at the end wins prizes (HPU swag provided by the instructor).

**Ways to Earn Money:**

**$1 bills (white borders):**
- Any correct answer in class
- Active participation in discussion
- Showing up prepared

**$3 bills (green borders):**
- "Side quests" for teams falling behind
- Example: "All team members complete the Teamwork Evaluation by Friday"
- These are designed to help struggling teams catch up

**$5 bills (yellow borders):**
- Outstanding work on major assignments
- Exceptional presentations
- Going above and beyond requirements

**Ways to Lose Money:**

**$1 fines:**
- Not standing when theme song plays
- Not responding to callback
- Sitting in the wrong seat (explained below)

### Team Treasurer

Each team designates a treasurer who:
- Holds the physical Monopoly money
- Tracks the team's balance
- Reports totals each Friday for "settlement"

**Critical rule: "Cash on hand only"**
- If the treasurer is absent on Friday, the team gets no credit for their balance
- This creates interdependence and accountability
- Teams quickly learn to communicate about absences

**If a team member will be absent:**
- They should notify their team (teams create group chats, etc.)
- Team can make arrangements
- Individual absences don't directly penalize the team (unless it's the treasurer on Friday)

### Friday Settlement and Seating

**Every Friday:**
1. Teams report their cash totals
2. Instructor tallies standings
3. Seating chart is updated for Monday based on Friday's standings

**"Tax Value" Seating:**
- Seating positions correspond to Monopoly board property groups
- Teams with more money "earn" better seats
- Higher-ranked teams sit in more prestigious locations
- Creates visible status hierarchy

**Rent System:**
- If someone sits in the wrong seat, the rightful team can charge rent
- Teams set their own rent rates
- Reinforces property rights and team territory

**Purpose:** The seating system makes the competition tangible and visible, reinforcing team identity and status.

## The Four Field Work Assignments

### Assignment Structure

Each of the four assignments (Weeks 8-11) follows this pattern:

**Monday:** Introduction to concept, initial discussion, begin work
**Wednesday:** Deep work time, instructor and peer check-ins
**Friday:** Presentations, feedback, Monopoly money settlement

**All work is collaborative and goes in the team's shared Google Doc.**

## Team Google Docs and Individual Portfolios

### The Shared Google Doc System

**Each team has a shared Google Doc** (created and linked by the instructor).

**All collaborative work goes in this shared doc:**
- Team branding (tartan, theme song, callback, mission statement, team photo)
- All four field work assignments
- Notes, planning, drafts

**Key requirement: Color-coded contributions**
- Each team member uses a different text color for their contributions
- This makes individual accountability visible
- Instructor can see who contributed what

**Example:**
- Student A writes in blue
- Student B writes in red
- Student C writes in green
- Student D writes in purple

### Individual Google Sites Portfolios

**Each student maintains their own Google Site portfolio.**

**For Field Work assignments:**
- Students must **embed** the team's shared Google Doc into their individual portfolio site
- This goes under the "Fieldwork" section of their site
- Instructor grades down if students don't embed the team doc

**Why embed rather than duplicate?**
- Maintains a single source of truth (the team's shared doc)
- Makes it easy to see team collaboration
- Prevents version control issues
- Students still get credit by embedding it on their own site

**How to embed a Google Doc in Google Sites:**
1. Open your Google Site in edit mode
2. Navigate to your Fieldwork section
3. Click Insert → Embed
4. Paste the link to the team's shared Google Doc
5. Click Insert
6. The document appears embedded (not just as a link)
7. Publish your site

## Properly Branded Work

### What "Branded Work" Means

The instructor expects creative freedom but requires visible team identity.

**Minimum branding requirements:**
- Team name (NATO name: Alpha, Bravo, etc.)
- Team colors (from tartan) visible somewhere
- Evidence that this is a team product, not individual work

**Examples of creative branding:**
- Mini-documentaries with team logo/colors
- Skits or performances with team callbacks
- Presentations with tartan color schemes
- Memes incorporating team identity
- Creative formats that represent team personality

**Instructor's Philosophy:**
> "If you think I'm going to hate it, you absolutely have to do it."

**What this means:**
- Creativity is encouraged everywhere, all the time
- Students should take risks with format and presentation
- Unusual approaches are rewarded, not penalized
- The instructor values originality and bold choices

**Examples from past semesters:**
- Teams creating mock news broadcasts about dangerous music
- Skits reenacting controversies around censored songs
- Branded social media accounts documenting HPU music culture
- Video essays with team visual identities throughout

### What Makes Work "Outstanding" ($5 Bonus)

Outstanding work typically includes:
- All members clearly contributed (evident in color-coding)
- Goes beyond minimum requirements
- Shows creative thinking and risk-taking
- Demonstrates genuine engagement with concepts
- Well-organized and clearly presented
- Team identity is evident and integrated

---

## Teamwork Evaluations

### What These Are

After each of the four assignments, students complete an **individual Teamwork Evaluation** via Microsoft Forms.

**Point values:**
- Evaluation 1 (after Hevner Mood Wheel): 5 points
- Evaluation 2 (after HPU's Music): 5 points
- Evaluation 3 (after Dangerous Music): 5 points
- Evaluation 4 (after Music and Community): 5 points

**Purpose:**
- Individual temperature checks
- Assess team dynamics
- Identify problems early
- Provide feedback to instructor

**Format:**
- Online form (MS Forms)
- Completed individually (not as a team)
- Relatively quick (designed to be completed in a few minutes)

**What's assessed:**
- How well the team is functioning
- Individual contributions
- Communication and collaboration
- Any concerns or issues

**Important:** These are individual assessments, not group grades. Students earn points for thoughtfully completing them.

---

## Individual Grades Within Teams

### How Grading Works

Even though the work is collaborative, **each student receives an individual grade** based on:

1. **Evidence of contribution** (visible through color-coding)
2. **Quality of their specific contributions**
3. **Teamwork evaluation responses**
4. **Participation in presentations**

**This prevents "free-rider" problems** where one student does all the work or some students coast on others' efforts.

### What the Instructor Looks For

**Strong individual contributions:**
- Substantive additions to the team doc (not just "I agree" comments)
- Evidence of research, analysis, or creative work
- Active participation in presentations
- Positive peer evaluations

**Weak individual contributions:**
- Minimal or missing color-coded work
- Surface-level comments
- Not mentioned in teammates' evaluations
- Absent from presentations

**Fair distribution of work:**
- Instructor expects rough equality of effort
- Doesn't have to be perfectly even
- But should be balanced enough that no one feels exploited

## Common Student Questions About Teamwork

### "How long should our assignment be?"

**Answer:**
- No specific length requirement
- Long enough to demonstrate engagement with the concept
- Quality over quantity
- Focus on depth of thinking, not word count

**Typical range:** 2-4 pages of content in the shared Google Doc, but creative formats may vary.

### "Can we do a video/skit/podcast instead of a written document?"

**Answer:** YES! Absolutely encouraged.

**Requirements:**
- Must still be documented in the shared Google Doc
- Include a link to the video/podcast/creative work
- Add a brief written component explaining the concept and team's approach
- Make sure all team members' contributions are visible

### "What if someone on our team isn't contributing?"

**This is a complex question - handle carefully:**

**The instructor's approach: "Figure it out"**

Mr. Turner's philosophy is that working through friction is part of learning teamwork. The teaching assistant should reinforce this while being supportive.

**Initial response:**
1. Ask: "Have you talked to them directly about it?"
2. Suggest: "What might be going on with them? Sometimes people ghost because they're overwhelmed or unsure how to contribute"
3. Encourage: "How can your team invite them back in? 'With malice toward none, with charity for all'"

**Important reassurance:**
- "If someone ghosts the team, it won't affect your team's grade - individual grades are based on individual contributions"
- "This means you can afford to be generous and keep the door open for them to rejoin"

**If the student wants to escalate:**
- "Mr. Turner's approach is for teams to work through this themselves - that's part of what makes teamwork challenging and valuable"
- "Use your teamwork evaluations to document contributions honestly"
- "If there's a serious issue beyond just unequal contribution, then talk to Mr. Turner"

**Don't:**
- Suggest excluding or punishing the non-contributing member
- Promise the instructor will "fix" it
- Encourage the team to write off the absent member

**Do:**
- Validate that unequal contribution is frustrating
- Emphasize grace and second chances
- Remind them that individual accountability protects them from being penalized for others' choices
- Encourage creative problem-solving ("What if you assigned them a very specific, small task?")

### "Can we change our team name/branding/members?"

**Name/Members:** No - these are set by the instructor and fixed for the unit.

**Branding (tartan, theme song, callback, mission):** Ask the instructor, but generally these should remain consistent for identity purposes.

### "What happens if our treasurer is absent on Friday?"

**Answer:**
- The team doesn't get credit for their cash balance that week
- This is by design - it creates accountability
- Teams should communicate and plan ahead
- If the treasurer will be absent, they should alert the team early

### "How do we divide up the work fairly?"

**Suggestions:**
- Play to strengths: If someone loves interviewing, they do that; if someone's great at organizing, they compile
- Rotate roles: Each assignment, different people take lead on different parts
- Set deadlines: Agree on when each person will contribute their section
- Use your group chat: Stay in communication throughout the week

**Remind them:** 
- The color-coding makes contributions visible, so everyone needs to pull their weight.
- Don't forget that core principle emphasizes synthesis:
> "Teamwork is not dividing a task into smaller components and assigning them to different group members, although this may be involved. Rather, teamwork is about knowledge or value creation through collaboration and synthesis."

### "Can we work on the assignment outside of class time?"

**Answer:** Absolutely! In fact, teams that work outside class time typically produce better results.

**Suggestions:**
- Use your group chat to coordinate
- Share the Google Doc link (everyone should have access)
- Meet in the library, dorm lounges, or virtually
- Divide tasks and reconvene

### "How much creativity is too much?"

**Answer:**
> "If you think Mr. Turner is going to hate it, you absolutely have to do it."

**Translation:**
- There is no "too much" creativity
- Take risks
- Try unusual formats
- Be bold
- The worst outcome is being boring

**Caveat:** The creativity should still engage with the assignment concepts, not just be random.

## Religious Music and Live Music (Weeks 12-15)

**Important:** These assignments are **NOT part of the teamwork unit.**

### Week 12: Religious Music (20 points)

- **Individual assignment** (no longer working in teams)
- Students explore religious or spiritual music traditions
- Completed individually and documented on individual Google Sites

### Week 15: Live Music (20 points)

- **Individual assignment**
- Students attend a live music event and reflect on the experience
- Documented individually on Google Sites

**Why the shift?**
- By Week 12, the "game" is over
- Students transition from collaborative field work back to individual work
- However, if the teamwork unit was successful, students may still choose to attend live music events together (even though it's not required)

**From Mr. Turner:**
> "If I do my job right, the groups are a little difficult to get back apart."

**What this means:** Even though the assignments become individual again, the social bonds formed during Weeks 8-11 may persist.

---

## Troubleshooting Team Dynamics

### "My team isn't communicating"

**Suggestions:**
1. Create a group chat (text, GroupMe, Discord, whatever works)
2. Set a regular meeting time (even if brief)
3. Use the shared Google Doc for asynchronous communication
4. Assign a "communications lead" who checks in with everyone

**If communication remains poor:**
- This will show up in teamwork evaluations
- Encourage them to address it in their evaluation responses
- Escalate to instructor if it's affecting work quality

### "We have conflicting ideas about what to do"

**This is normal and healthy!**

**Suggestions:**
1. Discuss pros and cons of each approach
2. Vote if necessary
3. Remember: creative conflict can lead to better outcomes
4. Sometimes combining ideas works better than choosing one

**Remind them:** Teams with different temperaments will naturally have different ideas - that's why diversity matters.

### "We're falling behind in Monopoly money"

**Solutions:**
1. Focus on class participation (easy $1 bills add up)
2. Look for side quests ($3 bonuses)
3. Go above and beyond on the next assignment (potential $5 bonus)
4. Make sure everyone responds to callbacks and stands for theme song (avoid fines)
5. Make sure treasurer is present on Fridays

**Reassure them:** The economy is designed so teams can catch up - it's not hopeless.

### "Our team doesn't want to sit in the back"

**Answer:** This is by design!

**Explanation:**
- Seating is based on Monopoly money totals
- This creates visible stakes for the competition
- Earn more money through participation and strong work
- The seating will update each week based on performance

**Don't:** Undermine the system by suggesting they ignore the seating chart.

## When to Escalate to Instructor

The teaching assistant handles **logistics and technical questions**. Escalate to instructor for:

### Team Conflict Issues
- Serious interpersonal conflicts
- Accusations of unfair contribution
- Requests to change teams or remove members
- Concerns about harassment or disrespect

### Grading Questions
- "Why did we get this grade?"
- "Can we redo this assignment?"
- "How are individual grades determined?"

### Creative/Conceptual Questions
- "Is this idea good enough?"
- "Does our project address the assignment properly?"
- "We don't understand what 'dangerous music' means"

### Policy Questions
- "Can we have an extension?"
- "What if someone has to miss the presentation?"
- "Can we change our team name?"

---

## Tips for Teaching Assistant

### Encourage Team Autonomy

**When teams ask for approval:**
- "That sounds like a creative approach - go for it!"
- "What does your team think about it?"
- "Remember: if you think Mr. Turner will hate it, you absolutely have to do it"

**Don't:**
- Pre-approve every creative idea
- Act as a gatekeeper for what's acceptable
- Discourage unusual approaches

### Emphasize the Process, Not Just the Product

**When teams are struggling:**
- "Learning to work through this is part of what teamwork is about"
- "Use your different temperaments - who on your team is good at organizing? Who has bold ideas?"
- "This is harder than individual work, but that's the point"

### Validate the Challenge

**Teamwork is difficult:**
- "It's normal for teams to have disagreements"
- "Learning to collaborate effectively takes practice"
- "This unit is designed to push you out of your comfort zone"

### Celebrate Team Identity

**When you see good branding or strong team cohesion:**
- "I love how your tartan colors show up in everything you do"
- "Your team really responded to that callback - nice identity!"
- "You can tell you're working well together"
