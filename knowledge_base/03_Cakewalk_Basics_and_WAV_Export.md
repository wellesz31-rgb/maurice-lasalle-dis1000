## Overview: What is Cakewalk Next?

Cakewalk Next is a free digital audio workstation (DAW) that students use in DIS 1000 to create original music compositions. It's part of the BandLab suite of tools and runs on Windows computers.

**What students will use it for:**
- Creating sound compositions
- Building texture compositions
- Programming beats and loops
- Composing melodies
- Recording and arranging original songs
- Working with virtual instruments and effects

**Key point:** Students don't need to become audio engineering experts. They need to know enough to create simple compositions and export them as WAV files to embed in their Google Sites.

---

## Getting Started with Cakewalk Next

### Installation and Access

Cakewalk Next is free and requires a BandLab account.

**To install:**
1. Visit the Cakewalk website or BandLab
2. Download Cakewalk Next
3. Install on a Windows computer
4. Sign in with your BandLab account

**System requirements:**
- Windows 10 or later
- Reasonable amount of RAM and storage
- Audio interface (built-in sound card is usually fine for this course)

### First Launch: The Product Center

When you first open Cakewalk, you'll see the Product Center showing:
- Your installed version of Cakewalk Next
- Available add-ons and plugins
- Updates

This is just the management interface. To actually start making music, you need to create or open a project.

---

## Creating a New Project

### Starting Fresh

**To create a new project:**
1. Click **File** → **New Project** (or press Ctrl+N)
2. Cakewalk creates a blank project with a Master track
3. You're now in the main editing interface

**What you'll see:**
- **Master track** at the top (controls overall volume and effects)
- **Transport controls** (play, stop, record buttons)
- **Timeline** showing measures and beats
- **Empty workspace** where you'll add tracks

### Saving Your Project

**Important:** Save early and save often!

**To save:**
1. Click **File** → **Save Project** (or press Ctrl+S)
2. Choose a location (create a dedicated folder for your DIS 1000 projects)
3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Week1_Sound_Composition")
4. Click **Save**

**File extension:** Cakewalk projects save as .cwp files. These are project files that contain all your tracks, settings, and edits—but they are NOT audio files. You'll need to export to WAV separately (see below).

---

## Understanding the Interface

### The Track View (Main Workspace)

This is where you'll spend most of your time. It shows:

**Left side:**
- Track list with track names
- Volume faders and pan knobs
- Mute (M), Solo (S), Record (red dot), and monitoring buttons
- Track icons showing what type of track it is

**Right side (Timeline):**
- Horizontal grid showing measures and beats
- Audio clips (waveforms) if you've recorded or imported audio
- MIDI clips (colored blocks) if you've programmed virtual instruments

### The Transport Bar (Top)

Key controls you'll use:

- **Play button** (triangle): Plays your project
- **Stop button** (square): Stops playback
- **Record button** (red circle): Arms recording
- **Rewind/Fast-forward**: Navigate through your project
- **Tempo display**: Shows BPM (beats per minute)—you can click to change it
- **Time display**: Shows where you are in the project (measures:beats:ticks)

### The Browser (Right Panel)

Access sounds and tools:

- **Inspect tab**: Browse and audition loops and samples
- **Browse tab**: Access BandLab sounds library
- **Loops, Shots, Packs**: Pre-made audio content you can drag into your project

---

## Working with Tracks

### Types of Tracks

**Audio Track:**
- For recording live sound (microphone, guitar, etc.)
- For importing audio files
- Shows waveforms

**Instrument Track:**
- For MIDI/virtual instruments (piano, drums, synths, etc.)
- You "play" these using MIDI data or by programming notes
- Shows colored MIDI clips

**To add a track:**
1. Click **Insert** menu
2. Choose:
   - **Insert Audio Track** (Ctrl+T) for recording or importing audio
   - **Insert Instrument Track** (Ctrl+Shift+T) for virtual instruments

### Adding Virtual Instruments

This is how you get sounds like piano, drums, synths, etc.

**Method 1: Insert Instrument Track**
1. Click **Insert** → **Insert Instrument Track**
2. A dialog appears showing available instruments
3. Browse by category (BandLab, Built-In, VST, VST3)
4. Select an instrument (e.g., "Classic Rock" drum kit, "Ballad" piano)
5. Click **Add**
6. The track appears with the instrument loaded

**Method 2: Browse and Drag**
1. Open the **Browser** panel on the right
2. Click **Inspect** tab
3. Browse **Instruments** section
4. Click on an instrument to preview it
5. Drag it onto an empty area of your track view
6. Cakewalk automatically creates an instrument track

### Common BandLab Instruments

Students will frequently use:

- **Drum Kits**: Various styles (Rock, Hip Hop, Electronic, etc.)
- **Piano/Keys**: Ballad, Bright Piano, Electric Piano
- **Bass**: Classic, Synth Bass
- **Guitar**: Acoustic, Electric
- **Synths**: Lead synths, pads, arpeggios
- **Strings, Brass, Vocals**: For more complex compositions

---

## Recording and Programming

### Recording Audio (Microphone, Voice, etc.)

1. Create an Audio Track (Insert → Insert Audio Track)
2. Make sure your microphone is connected and recognized by Windows
3. Click the **Record Arm** button (red dot) on the track
4. Click the main **Record** button in the transport bar
5. Perform/speak/sing
6. Click **Stop** when done
7. A waveform appears on your track

### Programming MIDI (Virtual Instruments)

Most students won't record MIDI with a keyboard—they'll draw notes or use loops.

**Using Loops:**
1. Open the **Browser** → **Inspect** → **Loops**
2. Browse by instrument type and style
3. Click a loop to preview it
4. Drag it onto your timeline
5. Cakewalk creates the appropriate track and places the loop

**Drawing/Editing MIDI notes (Advanced):**
1. Right-click on a MIDI clip → **View** → **Piano Roll**
2. Use the pencil tool to draw notes
3. Adjust length, pitch, and timing
4. This is more advanced—most students will primarily use loops

---

## Working with BandLab Sounds

### Accessing the Sound Library

The Browser panel gives you access to thousands of royalty-free sounds:

**Loops:**
- Drum patterns
- Bass lines
- Melodic phrases
- Rhythm guitar patterns
- Etc.

**Shots:**
- One-shot sounds (single drum hits, sound effects, etc.)

**Instruments:**
- Virtual instruments you can play or program

### Using Loops Effectively

**How to use:**
1. Browse and preview loops
2. Drag promising loops onto your timeline
3. Loops automatically snap to the grid (measures/beats)
4. Stack multiple loops on different tracks to build a full arrangement
5. Trim, copy, or repeat loops to create longer sections

**Tip for students:** Don't overthink it. Experiment! Try different combinations and see what sounds good together.

---

## Applying Effects

### The Effects Browser

Effects modify how your tracks sound (reverb, EQ, compression, distortion, etc.).

**To add an effect:**
1. Click on a track to select it
2. In the track's **FX** section (left side), click to open the effects rack
3. Click **+** to add an effect
4. Browse available effects:
   - **BandLab**: Simple, user-friendly effects
   - **Built-in**: More advanced effects
5. Select an effect and click **Add**

**Common effects students might use:**
- **Reverb**: Adds space/ambiance
- **Delay**: Creates echoes
- **EQ**: Adjusts tone (bass, treble, etc.)
- **Compression**: Evens out volume
- **Distortion/Overdrive**: For gritty guitar/bass sounds
- **Chorus/Flanger**: Modulation effects

**Don't stress about this:** For basic DIS 1000 assignments, effects are optional. Focus on getting sounds and structure right first.

---

## Arranging Your Composition

### The Timeline and Grid

Cakewalk's timeline is organized in measures (bars) and beats.

**Time signature:** Most projects default to 4/4 (four beats per measure)
- This is the most common in popular music
- Each measure = 4 beats
- Students can change this if needed, but 4/4 works for most assignments

**Viewing options:**
- Use **View** menu to show/hide various panels
- **Show BandLab Sounds** (shortcut: 'B' or F5): Opens the browser
- **Show Track Plugins** (F3): Opens effects for selected track

### Building Structure

For composition assignments, students should think about:

**Basic song structure concepts:**
- Intro
- Verse
- Chorus
- Bridge
- Outro

**In Cakewalk:**
- Arrange different sections by placing loops/clips at different points in the timeline
- Use variety: change instrumentation, add/remove tracks for different sections
- Create repetition: copy and paste clips to repeat sections

**Example workflow:**
1. Measures 1-4: Intro (simple drum pattern)
2. Measures 5-12: Verse (add bass and melody)
3. Measures 13-20: Chorus (fuller arrangement)
4. Measures 21-28: Verse 2 (similar to first verse)
5. Measures 29-36: Chorus (repeat chorus section)
6. Measures 37-40: Outro (fade out or simplify)

---

## Exporting Your Composition to WAV

**This is critical!** Students must export their Cakewalk projects as WAV files to upload to Google Drive and embed in their Google Sites.

### Step-by-Step Export Process

**Step 1: Make sure your project is complete**
- Play through the entire project to make sure everything sounds right
- Check that all tracks are audible (not muted)
- Adjust the Master track volume if needed (don't let it clip/distort)

**Step 2: Open the Export Audio dialog**
1. Click **File** menu
2. Click **Export Audio** (or press Ctrl+E)
3. The Export Audio dialog appears

**Step 3: Configure export settings**

The Export Audio dialog has several sections. Here's what to set:

**Source:**
- Leave as **Master** (this exports the final mix of all tracks)

**Range:**
- Select **Entire project** (this exports everything from start to finish)
- (Alternatively, select "Time selection" or "Loop region" if you only want part of the project)

**Format section (IMPORTANT):**

**File type: WAV**
- This is the required format for DIS 1000
- WAV is uncompressed, high-quality audio

**Sample rate: 44100 Hz**
- This is standard CD quality
- Should be the default—don't change it unless you have a reason

**Bit depth: 16 bit**
- Also standard for CD quality
- Adequate for this course

**Dithering: Triangular**
- This is fine—leave as default

**Normalize:**
- Select **None** (or leave default)
- Normalization adjusts overall volume—not necessary for this course

**Step 4: Choose export location**

After clicking "Export" at the bottom of the dialog:

1. A file browser window appears
2. Navigate to where you want to save the file
   - **Recommended:** Create a dedicated folder for your DIS 1000 audio exports
   - Example: `Documents/DIS1000/Exports/`
3. The file name is auto-filled (usually your project name)
   - You can rename it if desired
   - **Use descriptive names:** `Turner_Week1_SoundComp.wav`
4. Verify **Save as type:** shows `*.wav`
5. Click **Save**

**Step 5: Wait for export to complete**
- Cakewalk processes the audio (this takes a few seconds to a minute depending on project length)
- A progress bar may appear
- When finished, you'll have a WAV file in your chosen location

**Step 6: Find your exported file**
- Open your file explorer
- Navigate to the folder where you exported
- You should see a `.wav` file with your chosen name
- **This is the file you'll upload to Google Drive** (see Document 4)

---

## Common Export Issues

### "I can't find my exported file"

**Problem:** You exported but don't remember where it went.

**Solution:**
- Look in your project folder (where your .cwp file is saved)—Cakewalk often defaults to exporting there
- Check `Documents/Cakewalk Projects/[Project Name]/Audio/`
- Search your computer for `*.wav` files modified today
- Next time, pay attention to the export location and save to a dedicated folder

### "My export is silent or has no sound"

**Possible causes:**
1. All tracks were muted during export
2. Master volume was turned all the way down
3. You selected the wrong source (e.g., a single muted track instead of Master)

**Solution:**
- Go back to Cakewalk
- Make sure tracks are not muted (M buttons should not be lit)
- Check Master track volume (should be at a reasonable level)
- Re-export, making sure **Source** is set to **Master**

### "My export file is huge"

**Problem:** WAV files are uncompressed, so they can be large (1 minute ≈ 10 MB).

**This is normal!** For the purposes of DIS 1000:
- WAV files of 2-3 minutes will be 20-30 MB
- This is fine for uploading to Google Drive
- Google Sites can handle embedding files of this size

**If the file is unexpectedly huge:**
- Make sure you exported only the section you intended (not 10 minutes of blank space after your song ends)
- Trim your project in Cakewalk before exporting if needed

### "The export sounds different from playback in Cakewalk"

**Possible causes:**
1. Some effects didn't render properly (rare)
2. You're playing it back on different speakers/headphones
3. System audio settings are different

**Solution:**
- Listen to the exported WAV in multiple places (Cakewalk, Windows Media Player, your Google Site)
- If it genuinely sounds wrong, try exporting again
- Make sure all plugins and effects are properly enabled before export

## Tips for Successful Compositions

### Start Simple

Students often get overwhelmed trying to make complex arrangements.

**Good approach:**
- Start with a basic drum loop
- Add a bass line
- Add one melodic element (piano, synth, guitar)
- That's a complete composition!
- Add more layers only if time permits

### Use the Browser Liberally

You don't have to create everything from scratch.

**It's okay to:**
- Use pre-made loops
- Combine existing sounds in new ways
- Focus on arrangement and structure rather than sound design

**What matters:**
- Your creative decisions about what sounds to use
- How you arrange them
- The overall structure and flow

### Listen and Adjust

**Workflow:**
1. Add some sounds
2. Play it back
3. Adjust (change volumes, mute tracks, swap sounds)
4. Play it back again
5. Repeat until it sounds right

**Don't get stuck perfecting one detail—finish the whole piece first, then refine.**

### Save Multiple Versions

If you're experimenting with major changes:

1. **File** → **Save Project As**
2. Add a version number or descriptor: `Week1_SoundComp_v2.cwp`
3. Now you can experiment without losing your original

## Assignment-Specific Guidance

### Week 1: Sound Composition

**Focus:** Exploring timbre (the quality/texture of sounds)

**What to do:**
- Experiment with different instruments and sound textures
- Don't worry about melody or rhythm yet
- Think about creating sonic landscapes

**Cakewalk approach:**
- Browse instruments and try unusual sounds (pads, ambient sounds, sound effects)
- Layer multiple instruments
- Use effects like reverb and delay to create space

### Week 2: Texture Composition

**Focus:** Linear vs. non-linear time, how much is going on

**What to do:**
- Create contrasts between sparse sections (few instruments) and dense sections (many instruments)
- Experiment with how many things are happening at once

**Cakewalk approach:**
- Start with one or two tracks, then add more progressively
- Create sections with different levels of complexity

### Week 3: Beats and Loops / Rhythm

**Focus:** Pulse, grouping, meter (duple/triple, simple/compound)

**What to do:**
- Work with drum patterns and rhythmic loops
- Experiment with different time signatures if desired

**Cakewalk approach:**
- Use drum loops from the browser
- Layer percussion sounds
- Adjust tempo to change the feel

### Week 4: Original Song (Short Form)

**Focus:** Creating a complete (though brief) song structure

**What to do:**
- Combine elements: rhythm, bass, melody
- Create a recognizable song form (intro-verse-chorus or similar)

**Cakewalk approach:**
- Use loops for rhythm and bass foundation
- Add a melodic instrument for the main theme
- Arrange into clear sections (copy/paste clips to create structure)

### Week 5: Emotional Melody

**Focus:** How melody conveys emotion

**What to do:**
- Create a melody that expresses a specific emotion
- Think about contour (up and down movement), climax (high point)

**Cakewalk approach:**
- Choose a melodic instrument (piano, synth, strings)
- Either use melodic loops or program notes in Piano Roll (more advanced)
- Accompany with simple harmony/rhythm

### Week 6: Autoharp / 16-Bar Blues

**Focus:** Harmony (vertical organization of pitch)

**What to do:**
- Work with chord progressions
- Understand how simultaneous notes create harmony

**Cakewalk approach:**
- For Autoharp: Find guitar or harp sounds, create simple chord progressions
- For Blues: Use blues loops, bass lines, and blues piano/guitar sounds
- Classic 12-bar or 16-bar blues structure

### Week 7: Artist Profile

#### Artist Profile Research 

**Focus:** Learning to use library resources for music research

This assignment teaches research skills that will be essential for the Connection to Your Major project later in the semester.

**Part 1: Research (Due Week 6)**

Students must work with a research librarian to find sources about their favorite musical artist.

**Required sources (minimum 5):**
- Article from a trade publication (Vibe, Source, Rolling Stone, etc.)
- Album or single review
- Interview (YouTube, podcast, print)
- Other scholarly or credible sources

**Working with the Research Librarian:**

**Primary contact:** Bryan Nicholls at Smith Library
- Students should set up an appointment with Bryan (or another librarian if Bryan is unavailable)
- The librarian will help students use library databases, research guides, and the catalog
- Students must document the meeting with a photo or signed business card

**Research strategies Bryan Nicholls recommends:**

1. **Start with library resources:**
   - Use the Music Research Guide: https://guides.highpoint.edu/mus
   - Search library catalog for books and articles
   - Use library databases for trade publications and reviews

2. **Supplement with strategic web searching:**
   - Google is fine for initial exploration
   - Amazon.com can be useful - find books about your artist, note the ISBN, then search the library catalog with that ISBN to see if the library has it
   - Wikipedia is acceptable for overview, but DON'T cite Wikipedia itself - instead, go to the sources listed at the bottom of the Wikipedia article and explore those original sources

3. **Use AI for keyword generation:**
   - If you're struggling to find sources, ask AI: "What keywords should I use to search for academic sources about [artist]?"
   - AI can suggest alternative search terms you might not have thought of
   - But use the library databases for actual searching, not just AI

**Creating the Bibliography:**

Students must format their bibliography in Chicago Notes-Bibliography style.

**Important: Discourage usage of citation generators!**

**Why citation generators are problematic:**
- They're often wrong or inconsistent
- Students learn nothing about citation format
- They create bad habits

**The rule:**
- Students can write citations themselves using the Chicago Style Citation Guide, OR
- Students can use a citation generator and then CORRECT it using the guide
- Either way, they must engage with the citation guide: https://guides.highpoint.edu/chicagomanual

**Using AI for citations:**
- You can ask AI: "How do I cite a magazine article in Chicago Notes-Bibliography format?"
- AI can explain the format structure
- BUT you must still check it against the official guide
- And you're responsible for accuracy

**Part 2: Synthesis (Due mid-week 7)**

After gathering sources, students synthesize their research into:
- 500-700 word paper OR 3-5 minute podcast
- Must include: artist's musical style overview, personal connection to the artist, references to at least 2 songs
- Link or embed to Google Site "Studio Work" page

**Using AI for synthesis:**
Students can use AI to help organize and clarify their writing, but NOT to write for them.

**Good prompt example:**
> "I'm writing a short profile of my favorite musical artist for a college music course. Please act as my writing assistant and help me develop a clear structure, organize ideas, and write in a personal but academic tone. Don't write for me, but help me to structure and polish my writing."

**Students should:**
- Use AI for brainstorming structure
- Use AI for clarity and grammar checks
- Use AI to identify weak or unclear passages
- NOT use AI to generate the entire paper

**Part 3: Peer Review and Reflection (Due end of week 7)**

Students read/listen to a classmate's Artist Profile and write a 300-500 word reflection addressing:
- Whose work did you review?
- What did you learn from their research?
- How did their work make you think differently about your own artist?
- How does this connect to your own learning?

## Troubleshooting Common Problems

### "Cakewalk won't open / crashes on startup"

**Try:**
- Restart your computer
- Make sure Windows is updated
- Reinstall Cakewalk Next
- Check BandLab forums for known issues

### "I can't hear any sound when I play my project"

**Check:**
1. Master track volume—is it turned up?
2. Individual track volumes—are they turned up?
3. Windows system volume—is it muted or very low?
4. Headphones/speakers—are they connected and powered on?
5. Cakewalk audio settings—File → Preferences → Audio → Devices—make sure correct output device is selected

### "My tracks are out of sync / not lining up"

**Possible causes:**
- Clips aren't snapped to the grid
- Tempo changed midway through the project
- Clips were manually dragged off-beat

**Solution:**
- Enable **Snap to Grid** (magnet icon in toolbar)
- Make sure all clips start on a beat/measure line
- Use Edit → Quantize to align MIDI notes (advanced)

### "I added an instrument but there's no sound"

**Check:**
1. Did you actually add notes/MIDI data to the track? (If it's blank, there's nothing to play)
2. Is the track muted?
3. Is the instrument volume turned down?
4. Are you using the correct output device?

### "Cakewalk is running slow / laggy"

**Possible causes:**
- Too many effects/plugins
- Large project with many tracks
- Computer resources are limited

**Solutions:**
- Close other programs to free up RAM
- Freeze tracks (render effects to audio to reduce CPU load)—advanced feature
- Work with fewer tracks simultaneously
- Upgrade computer if persistently slow (not always feasible)

---

## Final Reminders

### Export is Separate from Saving

**Students often confuse these:**

- **Saving a project** (Ctrl+S) → Creates a .cwp file that only Cakewalk can open
- **Exporting audio** (Ctrl+E) → Creates a .wav file that can be played anywhere

**You need to do BOTH:**
1. Save your project regularly while working (in case you need to edit it later)
2. Export to WAV when finished (so you can submit it)

### Always Export as WAV for This Course

- Not MP3, not M4A, not OGG—**WAV** specifically
- This is a course requirement
- WAV is uncompressed and will work reliably for embedding in Google Sites

### Name Your Files Clearly

**Bad:** `audio.wav`, `export1.wav`, `final.wav`

**Good:** `Turner_Week3_BeatsAndLoops.wav`, `SoundComposition_Jan9.wav`

**Why:** You'll have multiple audio files throughout the semester. Clear names prevent confusion.

### Test Your Export

Before uploading to Google Drive and embedding in your site:

1. Find the exported WAV file on your computer
2. Double-click it to play in Windows Media Player (or another audio player)
3. Listen to make sure it sounds correct
4. If it sounds wrong, go back to Cakewalk and troubleshoot before re-exporting

---

## Getting Help

### When Students Should Use the Teaching Assistant

**Good questions for the teaching assistant:**
- "How do I add a drum track in Cakewalk?"
- "I exported my file but I can't find it—where does it save?"
- "My export has no sound—what did I do wrong?"
- "What's the difference between an Audio Track and an Instrument Track?"
- "How do I change the tempo of my project?"

### When Students Should Ask the Instructor

**Questions about creative/analytical content:**
- "Is my composition showing enough understanding of timbre?"
- "Does this melody sound emotional enough for the assignment?"
- "I don't understand what the assignment is asking for"

**The teaching assistant handles technical "how do I do this in the software" questions.**

**The instructor handles conceptual "what should I create and why" questions.**

---

## Summary: The Core Workflow

1. **Open Cakewalk Next** and create a new project
2. **Add tracks**: Insert Audio Tracks or Instrument Tracks
3. **Add sounds**: Browse BandLab sounds, drag in loops or virtual instruments
4. **Arrange**: Place clips on the timeline to create structure
5. **Adjust**: Tweak volumes, add effects (optional), refine arrangement
6. **Save your project** regularly (Ctrl+S)
7. **Export to WAV**: File → Export Audio (Ctrl+E)
   - Format: WAV
   - Sample rate: 44100 Hz
   - Bit depth: 16 bit
   - Source: Master
   - Range: Entire project
8. **Choose export location** and name your file clearly
9. **Verify the export** by playing it in a media player
10. **Upload to Google Drive** and embed in your Google Site (see Document 4)

That's it! You don't need to master every feature of Cakewalk—just these core steps will get you through all the composition assignments in DIS 1000.
