# Google Sites Structure & Navigation
## DIS 1000 Teaching Assistant Knowledge Base

---

## Overview: What Students Are Building

In DIS 1000, students create a Google Sites portfolio to document their work throughout the semester. This portfolio serves as:

- A digital record of their projects and reflections
- A showcase of their creative and analytical work
- Evidence of their learning and growth
- A professional artifact they can share with others

**Model Site:** https://sites.google.com/view/dis1000sp26/home

**Important:** This is the Spring 2026 model site. Always reference the most current model site provided by your instructor, as the link may change each semester.

Students should reference the model site frequently to understand the expected structure and organization.

## Understanding the Model Site Structure

### The Homepage

The homepage serves as the entry point and navigation hub for the entire site. It should include:

- **Site title** (typically "DIS 1000 - [Student Name]")
- **Welcome message or introduction**
- **Clear navigation** to main sections
- **Professional appearance** (clean layout, readable fonts, consistent formatting)

### Main Navigation Structure

The DIS 1000 ePortfolio uses a work-type organization rather than a weekly structure. According to the course syllabus, your site must have this structure:

```
Home
├── About Me
├── Best Possible Future
Studio Work
├── Work from Weeks 1-7
├── Composition or Analysis Track assignments
Fieldwork  
├── Work from Weeks 8-15
├── Teamwork projects
├── Religious Music
├── Live Music
Resilience
├── Weeks 1-7 Journal entries
├── Self-Care Check-in
Connection to Your Major
├── Works from Weeks 12-15
├── All CtM Scaffolding (Topic, Bibliography, Mind Map, Drafts)
├── Final Paper
```

**Key principle:** The structure organizes work by TYPE (Studio, Field, etc.) rather than by week or date. This makes it easier to see your growth in each area of the course.

## Google Sites Interface: Key Components

### The Pages Panel (Right Side)

**Location:** Click "Pages" in the top-right corner of the editing interface

**What it shows:**
- Home (the main landing page)
- All other pages in your site
- Page hierarchy (main pages and sub-pages)

**What you can do:**
- View all pages at once
- Rearrange page order
- Create new pages
- Organize pages into hierarchies

### The Insert Panel (Right Side)

**Location:** Click "Insert" in the top-right corner

**What it shows:**
- Text box (for adding written content)
- Images (for uploading photos or graphics)
- Embed (for adding external content like audio files, videos, or other websites)
- Drive (for inserting files from Google Drive)

**Common use:** Students will use this frequently to add content to their pages.

### Content Blocks (Right Side, Under Insert)

**What they are:** Pre-designed layouts for organizing content on a page

**Common layouts:**
- Image with text
- Multiple columns
- Image galleries
- Title sections

**When to use them:** When you want professional-looking layouts without having to manually position everything

### The Top Toolbar

**Key buttons:**
- **Publish:** Makes your site live and shareable (important!)
- **Preview:** Shows how your site will look to visitors
- **Settings:** Controls site-wide options like site name, visibility, etc.
- **Undo/Redo:** Fixes mistakes

---

## Creating Your Site Structure

### Step 1: Create Main Section Pages

1. Click the **Pages** tab on the right
2. At the bottom of the pages list, click the **"+ New page"** button (or click the floating action button with a page icon)
3. A dialog will appear with these options:
   - **New page** (creates a standard page)
   - **New menu section** (creates a navigation group)
   - **Full page embed** (embeds an entire external page)
   - **New link** (creates a navigation link to an external site)

4. Select **"New page"**
5. Type the page name (e.g., "Studio Work")
6. Press Enter or click away

**Result:** A new page appears in your Pages list and in your site navigation.

### Step 2: Create Sub-Pages (Nested Pages)

To create a page hierarchy (like "Studio Work" with specific assignment pages underneath):

1. Click the **Pages** tab
2. Find the main page you want to nest pages under (e.g., "Studio Work")
3. Click the **three dots** (⋮) next to that page name
4. Select **"Add subpage"** from the menu
5. Name your sub-page (e.g., "Week 1 - About Me")
6. Press Enter

**Result:** The new page appears indented under the main page, showing the hierarchy.

**Alternative method:**
1. Create a new page using the "+ New page" button
2. In the Pages list, **click and drag** the new page slightly to the right under an existing page
3. Release—it will indent and become a sub-page

### Step 3: Arrange Your Pages

Pages appear in your navigation menu in the order they're listed in the Pages panel.

**To reorder pages:**
1. Click the **Pages** tab
2. **Click and drag** a page up or down in the list
3. Release when it's in the desired position

**To change page hierarchy:**
1. **Click and drag** a page left or right to change its indentation level
2. Drag left to make it a main page
3. Drag right to make it a sub-page under the page above it

## Page Structure Best Practices

### Keep It Simple and Organized

**Good structure:**
- Clear section names ("Studio Work", "Resilience")
- Logical groupings (all related assignments together)
- Consistent naming (e.g., "Week 1 - Title", "Week 2 - Title")
- Not too many levels (Home → Section → Assignment is usually enough)

**Avoid:**
- Vague page names ("Page 1", "Stuff", "Things")
- Too many sub-levels (Home → Section → Subsection → Sub-subsection → Assignment)
- Inconsistent organization (some assignments by week, others by type)

### Match the Model Site Structure

Students should generally follow the model site's organizational approach:

1. **Home page** as the entry point
2. **Main sections** for major course components (Studio Work, Field Work, Resilience, Connection to Major)
3. **Sub-pages** for individual assignments or project types within each section

**Why this matters:** Consistency makes it easier for instructors to review work and for students to navigate each other's sites.

## Adding Content to Pages

### Using Text Boxes

**When to use:** For written reflections, descriptions, explanations, or any text-heavy content

**How to add:**
1. Click where you want the text to appear on the page
2. Click **Insert** → **Text box**
3. A text box appears—click inside it to start typing
4. Use the toolbar to format text (bold, italic, headings, lists, alignment)

**Best practices:**
- Use headings to organize longer content
- Break up long paragraphs for readability
- Keep formatting simple and consistent

### Using Images

**When to use:** For photos, screenshots, graphics, or visual documentation

**How to add:**
1. Click **Insert** → **Images**
2. Choose upload source:
   - Upload from computer
   - Select from Google Drive
   - Search the web (be careful with copyright!)
   - Use a URL
3. Click and drag the image to resize
4. Click the image and use the toolbar to adjust alignment, add captions, or wrap text

**Best practices:**
- Make sure images are relevant to the content
- Add captions or context if needed
- Resize appropriately (not too large or too small)

### Using Content Blocks

**When to use:** For professional-looking layouts that combine images and text

**How to add:**
1. Click where you want the content block
2. Click **Insert** → scroll down to **Content Blocks**
3. Browse the layout options (image on left with text on right, multiple columns, etc.)
4. Click a layout to add it
5. Click on the placeholder elements to replace with your content

**Best practices:**
- Choose layouts that serve the content (don't just use them because they look cool)
- Keep layouts consistent across similar pages

## Embedding Content (Audio, Video, etc.)

This is particularly important for DIS 1000 because students will embed audio files from their music projects.

### The Embed Function

**What it does:** Allows you to insert content from external sources (YouTube videos, Google Drive files, audio players, etc.)

**How to use:**
1. Click where you want the embedded content
2. Click **Insert** → **Embed**
3. A dialog appears with two tabs:
   - **By URL:** Paste a link to the content
   - **Embed code:** Paste HTML embed code (advanced)

4. Most students will use **By URL**
5. Paste the shareable link
6. Click **Insert**

**Common uses in DIS 1000:**
- Embedding audio files from Google Drive (for Cakewalk projects)
- Embedding YouTube videos (for intro videos or music analysis)
- Embedding other Google Docs (for longer written reflections)

**See Document 4 for detailed instructions on embedding audio files specifically.**

## Publishing Your Site

### Making Your Site Live

Until you publish, your site is only visible to you.

**To publish:**
1. Click the **Publish** button in the top-right corner
2. A dialog appears asking you to review your site name and URL
3. Choose who can view your site:
   - **Public** (recommended for class)
   - **Restricted** (discouraged: instructor will not have access)
1. Click **Publish**

**Important:** You must publish for your instructor to see your work!

### CRITICAL: Re-Publishing After Changes

**From the course syllabus:** "You must re-publish your site any time you add to it or make changes: inaccessible work will be considered late."

This means:
- Every time you add new content, you must click **Publish** again
- Changes you make are NOT automatically visible to your instructor
- If your instructor can't access your work because you forgot to re-publish, it counts as late work (80% credit maximum)

**Best practice:** After completing any assignment and adding it to your site, immediately click **Publish** to make it visible.

### Sharing Your Site Link

After publishing:
1. Click the **link icon** in the top toolbar (looks like a chain link)
2. Copy the URL that appears
3. Share this link with your instructor (usually by pasting it into a Blackboard assignment or email)

**The link will look something like:**
`https://sites.google.com/view/yoursite/home`

### Updating After Publishing

**Good news:** You don't need to publish a new site every assignment.

**How updates work:**
1. Make changes to your site (add content, create pages, etc.)
2. The changes auto-save
3. Click **Publish** again to make the new changes live
4. Your site link stays the same

## Common Navigation Issues

### "I can't find the page I just created"

**Possible causes:**
1. You created the page but didn't add any content, so it looks empty
2. The page is nested under another page and you forgot
3. You created the page in a different site by accident

**How to fix:**
- Check the **Pages** panel—all pages are listed there
- Look for nested pages (sub-pages appear indented)
- Make sure you're editing the correct site (check the site name at the top)

### "My pages are in the wrong order"

**Fix:** Use the Pages panel to drag and drop pages into the correct order.

### "I deleted a page by accident"

**Bad news:** Google Sites doesn't have an "undo delete" feature for pages.

**What to do:**
- Recreate the page
- If the page had important content, check if you have it saved elsewhere (Google Docs, email draft, etc.)
- **Prevention tip:** Before deleting, make sure you really want to delete that page

### "My navigation menu looks weird"

**Common issues:**
- Too many sub-levels (flatten your structure)
- Inconsistent page names (standardize them)
- Pages in illogical order (rearrange using Pages panel)

**Fix:** Review your Pages panel and reorganize to match the model site's clean hierarchy.

### "People can't see my site"

**Possible causes:**
1. You haven't published yet (click Publish!)
2. You set permissions to "Restricted" instead of "Public"
3. You shared the wrong URL (make sure you copied the link after publishing)

**How to fix:**
- Click **Publish** to make your site live
- Check sharing settings (Settings → Visibility)
- Copy the correct URL from the published site

## Mobile vs. Desktop Editing

### Desktop is Recommended for Editing

**Why:** The full editing interface (Pages panel, Insert panel, drag-and-drop functionality) works best on a computer with a larger screen.

### Mobile Viewing Works Fine

Your published site will look good on phones and tablets—Google Sites automatically adjusts the layout for different screen sizes.

### If You Must Edit on Mobile

**Limitations:**
- Harder to drag and drop pages
- Smaller screen makes complex layouts difficult
- Some features may be limited

**Tips:**
- Do major structure work (creating pages, organizing hierarchy) on a computer
- Use mobile for quick text edits or adding photos
- Always preview how your site looks on different devices

---

## Visual Guide: Key Interface Elements

### Where to Find Everything

**(Reference the annotated screenshot from Google_Site_Setup.jpg)**

**Top toolbar:**
- Publish button (top-right, blue)
- Preview, Settings, Share buttons

**Right panel tabs:**
- **Insert:** Add text, images, embeds, content blocks
- **Pages:** View and organize your site structure
- **Themes:** Change visual appearance (colors, fonts, layouts)

**Content blocks section:**
- Pre-designed layouts appear below the Insert options
- Click and drag them onto your page to use

**Main editing canvas:**
- Center area where you build your page content
- Click to add elements, drag to reposition

## Step-by-Step: Building Your First Assignment Page

Let's walk through creating a typical assignment page from the actual DIS 1000 course:

### Example: Creating the "About Me" Page

This is your first assignment, due 1/7/26 according to the syllabus.

1. **Create the page:**
   - Click **Pages** → **+ New page**
   - Name it: "About Me"
   - Make it a sub-page under "Home" (drag it slightly right under Home in the Pages list)

2. **Add assignment content per syllabus:**
   - The syllabus states: "ePortfolio set up: Create a Custom Header Image for your site, record a brief Intro Video (1-2 minutes) in which you introduce yourself, and embed it from YouTube (video can be Unlisted if you prefer)"

3. **Add a header image:**
   - Click at the top of the page
   - Click **Insert** → **Images**
   - Upload your custom header image
   - Resize and position as desired

4. **Embed your intro video:**
   - Click where you want the video
   - Click **Insert** → **Embed**
   - Paste your YouTube video URL
   - Click **Insert**
   - The video player appears on your page

5. **Add your Musical Life History:**
   - Click below the video
   - Click **Insert** → **Text box**
   - Type or paste your Musical Life History text
   - Format with headings or bold text if needed

6. **Preview and publish:**
   - Click **Preview** to see how it looks
   - If it looks good, click **Publish**
   - **Remember:** You MUST click Publish or your instructor cannot see your work!

## Checking Your Work Against the Model Site

### Regular Comparison

Students should periodically compare their site to the model site (https://sites.google.com/view/dis1000sp26/home):

**Questions to ask:**
1. Does my structure match the required sections (Home with About Me and Best Possible Future, Studio Work, Fieldwork, Resilience, Connection to Your Major)?
2. Are my pages organized by work type (not by week)?
3. Does my homepage provide a clear introduction with About Me content?
4. Are my assignments in the right sections?
5. Is my content clearly presented with appropriate formatting?
6. Have I re-published after adding or changing content?

### Not Everything Needs to Be Identical

**What should match:**
- Overall structure (main sections)
- General organization principles
- Professional appearance

**What can be different:**
- Personal style and voice
- Specific design choices (within reason)
- Order of assignments (as long as they're in the right sections)
- Additional content beyond required assignments

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

### "Nothing is showing up when I click Insert → Embed"

**Likely cause:** The URL you're trying to embed isn't shareable or doesn't support embedding.

**Fix:** 
- Make sure the file/video is set to "Anyone with the link" can view
- Check Document 4 for specific instructions on embedding audio from Google Drive

### "I embedded my audio file/video link but it isn't playing"

**Likely cause:** embedded audio and video don't play in the site editor.

**Fix:** 
- Click the drop-down menu next to the "Publish" button and click "View Published Site"
- Test the links: they should work

### "My text is formatting weirdly"

**Likely cause:** You copied and pasted text from another source (Word, email, etc.) and it brought along hidden formatting.

**Fix:**
- Highlight the text
- Click the **"Remove formatting"** button in the toolbar (looks like a T with an X)
- Reapply basic formatting (bold, headings) as needed

### "My site looks different on my phone than on my computer"

**This is normal!** Google Sites automatically adjusts layouts for different screen sizes.

**What to do:**
- Design primarily for desktop viewing (since that's what you and your instructor will use most)
- Check mobile view occasionally to make sure nothing looks broken
- Don't worry if elements stack vertically on mobile—that's expected

### "I accidentally made a sub-page a main page (or vice versa)"

**Fix:**
- Go to the Pages panel
- Click and drag the page left (to make it a main page) or right (to make it a sub-page)
- It will snap into the correct hierarchy level

---

## Final Reminders

### Publish Early and Often

- Don't wait until everything is perfect to publish
- Your instructor needs to see your work as you complete assignments
- You can (and should) update and republish throughout the semester

### Keep Your Structure Clean

- Stick to the model site's organizational approach
- Use clear, descriptive page names
- Don't create unnecessary extra pages

### Ask for Help When Stuck

- Check the model site first
- Use the teaching assistant for technical Google Sites questions
- Don't spend hours fighting with the interface—get help quickly so you can focus on the actual coursework

### This is a Portfolio, Not a Website Design Project

**Remember:** The goal is to showcase your work in DIS 1000, not to become a web designer.

**Priorities:**
1. Clear organization and navigation
2. All required content included
3. Professional appearance
4. Easy to find and review your work

**Not priorities:**
- Fancy animations or effects
- Complex custom layouts
- Trendy design elements

Keep it simple, keep it organized, and focus your creative energy on the actual assignments, not the container that holds them.
